Quota share and reinsurance alignment for Pacific Fleet policies We need to formalize the quota share arrangement with Zurich Re before the next underwriting cycle closes. The current reinsurance coverage is insufficient to absorb potential losses from the new vessel additions. Please review the updated exposure tables and confirm your team’s appetite by Friday EOD.
Alternative structuring for excess coverage and retrocession layers Given the recent spike in storm-related claims in Southeast Asia, we’re exploring a layered retrocession structure to distribute risk more evenly. The traditional quota share model is now too rigid for today’s volatile marine environment. I’ve drafted a proposal using aggregate excess coverage triggers — let’s schedule a call next week to align on terms.
Reinsurance recovery flags on M/V Ocean Liberty incident The loss adjustment for M/V Ocean Liberty is nearing closure, but our reinsurance partner is disputing the allocation method. They’re arguing the excess coverage should be applied per voyage rather than per policy year. This creates a significant gap in our recovery projection and requires internal review before escalation.
Operational restructuring for marine risk pooling To improve capital efficiency, we’re recommending a shift from fixed quota sharing to a sliding scale based on aggregate loss ratios. This approach better aligns reinsurer incentives with underwriting performance. It also reduces administrative friction when multiple parties are involved in the risk chain.
Confidential note regarding workplace tensions after reinsurance restructuring I’ve been informed that several junior underwriters are feeling alienated after the recent realignment of reinsurance teams. Some have mentioned rumors of forced transfers and loss of bonus eligibility tied to legacy quota share contracts. This is not official policy, but morale is dipping. Please advise how to address this sensitively.
Quick question about reinsurance allocation — private I’m confused about why the retrocession triggers changed overnight without internal memo. My manager said it’s “above my pay grade,” but now I’m getting emails from Zurich asking for data I don’t have access to. Did someone pull the plug on our old model without telling the team? I need clarity before I respond to clients.
Alert: Potential policy overlap detected in reinsurance portfolio System flagged a duplicate exposure in the North Atlantic fleet due to inconsistent retrocession reporting across three legacy systems. The quota share percentages assigned in System A conflict with those in System C. Recommend immediate reconciliation. Failure to resolve may trigger automatic suspension of new submissions under this block.
Follow-up on reinsurance placement for MV Ocean Horizon The reinsurance broker contacted us last week to finalize the excess coverage terms for the MV Ocean Horizon voyage. We’ve reviewed their proposal and confirmed alignment with our quota share structure. Please ensure the underwriting notes reflect the 65% retention and 35% cession before we sign off. The client is expecting confirmation by Friday, so time is tight.
Review needed: Retrocessional layer for Pacific cargo fleet I’ve just received the revised loss experience report from our retrocession partner in Singapore, and their proposed adjustment to the excess coverage trigger may impact our net exposure. This isn’t a simple tweak—it requires re-evaluating the entire layering structure. Can you pull the historical claims data from 2021–2023 for comparison? Let’s sync tomorrow morning before the committee meeting.
Urgent: Reinsurance recovery pending for flooded container vessel The cargo loss from the recent grounding in the Suez Canal has triggered our reinsurance claim, but the broker hasn’t yet submitted the formal documentation. We’re now at risk of missing the 30-day notification window. I’ve chased them twice, but they’re citing internal approval delays. They’ve assured me it’s “in process,” but we can’t afford to wait.
Contract renewal for third-party reinsurance facilitator Our current reinsurance intermediary has been inconsistent in response times, especially during peak claim seasons. They’ve missed two critical deadlines in the last quarter, and their reporting format remains incompatible with our internal system. I recommend we open the contract to competitive bidding next month. I’ve attached performance metrics for your review.
Compliance flag: Unapproved communication regarding reinsurance settlements During a routine review of encrypted channels, we discovered an unapproved email chain discussing confidential retrocession splits between two junior underwriters. The discussion included personal speculation about bonus allocations tied to claim outcomes. This violates our internal governance policy and exposes us to regulatory risk. Immediate remediation is required.
Informal check-in regarding workload and reinsurance team stress I noticed you’ve been working late three nights this week and missed your team lunch again. I know the reinsurance renewals are heavy right now, but your health matters more than any deadline. Have you spoken to your manager about redistributing some of the backlog? We have an Employee Assistance Program if you’re feeling overwhelmed. You’re not alone in this.
Quick question: Can I use the old quota share template for this cargo route? I’m drafting the reinsurance submission for the latest shipment from Rotterdam and I’m not sure if the old quota share template still applies. The broker mentioned terms have changed slightly since last year, but they didn’t send updated guidelines. Can you check the last approved version in the shared drive? I don’t want to rework this if it’s already been vetted. I’m under pressure to send it by EOD.
Retrocession claims processed for Q2 marine exposures The retrocession claims processed for Q2 marine exposures have been finalized and reconciled with the lead reinsurer. All documentation has been uploaded to the central claims repository under case ID MAR-2024-0887. Please confirm receipt and advise if any further validation is required from your team.
Follow-up on excess coverage allocation for tankers We’ve reviewed the excess coverage allocation for the three tankers under policy MAREX-1201 and confirmed the tiered limits align with our reinsurance treaty. The broker has acknowledged the adjustments and will circulate updated slips by Friday. Let’s schedule a brief sync next week to close the loop with the lead underwriter.
Quota share reconciliation delayed due to missing data The quota share reconciliation for the Pacific bulk carriers is currently on hold as we’re still awaiting loss details from the primary insurer in Singapore. This delay impacts our Q3 capital projection and has triggered a tier-2 alert in the risk dashboard. I’ve escalated to the Singapore office and will loop you in as soon as we have data.
Alternative reinsurance structures for offshore wind portfolio Given the volatility in traditional retrocession markets, we’re exploring parametric triggers and cat bonds as supplementary layers for your offshore wind exposure. The structure we’ve modeled reduces direct capital deployment by 22% while maintaining coverage integrity. Let me know if you’d like a deep-dive session next Tuesday.
Internal note: unapproved reinsurance terms on vessel pols I noticed the underwriter in Mumbai bypassed the standard quota share clause on vessel POL-3342 and used an ad-hoc 70/30 split without approval. The treaty manual clearly requires committee sign-off for deviations. I’ve flagged it in the compliance tracker and am drafting a reminder email to the team.
Alert: Unmatched reinsurance line item in MAR-2024-0912 System detected a mismatch between the reported loss amount and the reinsured portion for policy MAR-2024-0912. The excess coverage line item shows $1.8M claimed but only $1.2M is reflected in the reinsurance ledger. Please investigate and update the status code within 48 hours to avoid audit flags.
Personal data request from reinsurance partner – urgency A third-party reinsurer has requested the full claim history of employee #7742, including medical and incident reports tied to a marine casualty. This falls under GDPR Article 15 but requires prior legal review. I’ve attached the request and need your sign-off before we release anything. Please advise by EOD.
Updates to Quota share underwriting guidelines for Pacific marine risks Please review the revised quota share underwriting guidelines circulated yesterday for all marine reinsurance treaties operating in the Pacific region. These changes reflect updated loss ratio targets and require adjusted slip terms effective next quarter. Ensure your team aligns all new submissions with the revised exposure caps and ceding commission structures before finalizing any binders.
Clarification needed on risk transfer structure for Indian Ocean quotas I’ve been reviewing the latest treaty language for the Indian Ocean quota arrangement and noticed the language around insured value allocation differs from last year’s template. Could you confirm whether the 65% cession threshold still applies given the new aggregate limit clause? We’re preparing a client submission and want to avoid any misalignment with the retrocession terms. Also, please advise if the excess coverage trigger has been modified for storm surge events.
Alternative risk transfer mechanism for Caribbean marine portfolios Given the volatility in Caribbean marine losses, I recommend we shift from traditional quota share to a modified excess of loss structure with a sliding scale reinstatement feature. This better aligns with the cedant’s capital preservation goals and reduces volatility in their combined ratio. The retrocession layer we’ve modeled shows a 22% improvement in tail risk coverage under recent climate scenarios. Let’s schedule a call to walk through the actuarial assumptions.
Compliance review: unauthorized use of reinsurance terminology in client correspondence During a recent audit, we identified that two junior underwriters used the term “excess coverage” in internal emails to brokers without proper documentation of the underlying treaty. This violates our internal protocol which requires all such terminology to be pre-approved by the legal team. Please remind all team members that even informal communications may be subject to regulatory scrutiny. This is not a minor oversight — it exposes us to reputational risk.
Confidential: Request for assistance with employee reassignment due to reinsurance restructuring I’m reaching out on behalf of a long-serving employee whose role is being dissolved as part of the reinsurance operations consolidation. He’s been with us for 17 years and is struggling with the transition. We’re exploring internal redeployment options within marine underwriting and need HR guidance on how to handle his severance package respectfully. His emotional state is fragile and we want to avoid any perception of unfair treatment.
Quick question on retrocession layers for African shipping lanes Hey, I’m drafting the retrocession slip for the West African container route and the broker just sent back a version with a 10% higher attachment point. I know our internal model says 40%, but they’re pushing for 50% to make it more attractive to reinsurers. Do you think we can justify that shift without triggering compliance flags? I don’t want this to blow up in my face during next quarter’s audit.
Reinsurance data sharing breach incident — urgent review needed Our third-party data vendor mistakenly sent a file containing confidential marine reinsurance exposure details to a client in Singapore who is not party to the treaty. The file included aggregate limits, loss history, and internal cession percentages that were never meant for external eyes. We’ve initiated containment but need your legal team to advise on disclosure obligations and potential regulatory penalties. This could damage our credibility with key partners.
Update on IG Pool case escalation for MV Athena The IG Pool has formally acknowledged the large claims exposure from the grounding incident in the South China Sea. Our team is now aligning with the pooling protocol to distribute liability across members, per the 2023 revised guidelines. Please ensure the loss adjustment records reflect the shared assessment marked as confidential. This will trigger the next phase of fund allocation within 72 hours.
Internal note: Reinsurance exposure on mega-claims We’ve noticed a spike in aggregated losses from single events that now exceed our retention thresholds. The pooling mechanism we’ve relied on since 2020 is being pressured, and we need to revisit how we define “large claims” internally. Without clearer criteria, our reinsurance triggers may misfire during peak seasons. Let’s schedule a cross-team review before quarter end.
Follow-up: Claims distribution under the collective framework I’ve reviewed the latest submissions from the Asian regional desk and found three cases that meet the threshold for collective handling. They’re not labelled as IG-related, but the loss profiles match the historical pattern we’ve seen in pooled claims. Could you confirm if these can be routed to the central claims hub under the same protocol? Time is critical—each day delayed increases recovery risk.
Observations on claims coordination in marine reinsurance Many firms still treat large claims as isolated events, when the real efficiency lies in coordinated response networks. The current system lacks transparency, and when pooling isn’t clearly invoked, recovery timelines stretch unnecessarily. I’ve seen this cause disputes between reinsurers who didn’t realize they were already liable under silent agreements. A standardised trigger matrix would reduce friction.
Quick question about the big claim from the tanker collision Hey, I’m working on the Tanjung Priok collision claim and the loss is over $28M—really unusual for this vessel type. I noticed the original policy references “joint liability” and “shared recovery” but no explicit IG mention. Should I still treat this as pooled? The broker is breathing down my neck for a response by EOD.
Audit flag: Potential breach in claims handling protocol An internal audit uncovered that three high-value claims were processed without triggering the mandatory pooling notification. These weren’t flagged as “International Group” cases, but their size, location, and vessel class all align with the threshold criteria. Someone assumed discretion was allowed—this is a clear violation. The legal team will need to assess exposure.
Urgent: Need alignment on large loss handling for Pacific route We’ve had three incidents this month where the claim amount crosses the pooling line, but no one’s calling it out as such. The adjusters are handling them as standard reinsurance cases, which means we’re missing out on shared capital. I know the terminology varies, but the economic reality doesn’t—this needs to change immediately. I’m moving these to a watchlist until we standardise the trigger definitions.
Final review of IG Pool claims sharing policy for Q3 The IG Pool claims sharing policy for Q3 has been finalized and is now live in the reinsurance portal. Please ensure all large claims exceeding $5 million are flagged for pooling eligibility. This is not optional — failure to report may result in loss of indemnity coverage. We’ve also updated the internal checklist to reflect the latest IG Pool guidelines as of last week’s meeting.
Urgent: Required action on cross-border claim aggregation We’ve identified three separate marine claims from different vessels that, when aggregated, meet the threshold for international group pooling. Kindly consolidate the documentation under the new pooling protocol by EOD Friday. Do not submit them individually — the system will reject fragmented entries. I’ve attached the updated aggregation matrix for your reference.
Clarification needed on claims pooling thresholds I’m reviewing the recent claim submissions from Singapore and noticed that two incidents involving hull damage were treated as standalone despite clear similarity in cause and value. The pooling mechanism should treat these as a single exposure under the international group framework. Could you confirm if this was an oversight or intentional? We risk undercapitalizing our reinsurance position if we continue this pattern.
Request to adjust claim reporting format for IG Pool submissions Our system currently flags claims above $3M as high value, but the IG Pool currently requires aggregation of multiple smaller claims under $2M if they share a common peril. We need to upgrade our reporting engine to detect clustered incidents — not just single-event thresholds. Can we schedule a sync with your tech team next week? This is urgent for our April submission cycle.
Need advice on handling overlapping marine claims I’ve got two claims from the same shipowner — one for cargo loss off Nigeria, another for engine damage in the Suez Canal — both occurred within 72 hours. The system treats them as separate, but I think they should be combined under the pooling rules. I’m not sure if I’m overreaching or if this is standard practice. Can you advise before I close them?
Internal audit flag: potential breach in claims segregation During today’s audit, we discovered that a claims team in Mumbai submitted three ocean cargo incidents as individual claims to avoid triggering the pooling mechanism. This is a clear circumvention of international group guidelines and violates our internal controls. The responsible analyst is on leave — please initiate a formal review and notify legal. This is serious.
Feedback on pooling procedure – let’s improve clarity I’ve noticed an increasing number of emails asking whether minor vessel incidents qualify for pooling. This suggests our guidance isn’t clear enough. Let’s create a one-page flowchart for field teams explaining when to aggregate claims — based on causation, location, and time window. No jargon. Just simple decisions. We’re losing time and trust because people are afraid to make the right call.
Urgent: Pooling mechanism needed for offshore loss The offshore drilling incident off the coast of Nigeria has triggered a multi-million dollar claim that exceeds our single risk capacity. We need to activate the International Group pooling arrangement immediately to distribute liability. Our underwriting team has confirmed the incident falls under the IG’s defined large claims threshold. Please coordinate with the London claims hub to initiate the sharing protocol before EOD tomorrow.
Request for IG Pool Access – Tropical Storm Claims Following the recent chain of hurricane-related losses in the Caribbean, our exposure has crossed the IG’s mandatory pooling trigger. We’re not seeking redistribution yet, but we need to formally register this event in the IG database. The claims are still being assessed, but early estimates suggest we’re well above the $50M threshold. Let me know if you need the loss files forwarded for verification.
Internal Alert: Unauthorized IG Pool Discussions I’ve noticed a series of informal Slack messages between team members referencing claims sharing outside the formal IG framework. This violates our internal governance policy and exposes us to regulatory risk. All pooling activity must be routed through the designated compliance channel. Please review your recent communications and delete any unapproved references to pooling or claims distribution.
Quick question – IG claims handling process I’m reviewing a case involving a bulk carrier in the South China Sea and the loss amount is just over the IG’s minimum threshold. Is it standard practice to flag it for pooling even if the vessel operator is a long-term client? I want to make sure I don’t miss the window to request participation. Also, does the pool cover statutory liabilities or just hull damage? I’ve read the IG guidelines but want to confirm before submitting.
Data Integration Note – IG Pooling Flags Updated Our system has just rolled out the updated IG pooling triggers for 2024, including revised thresholds for large claims in the Asia-Pacific region. You’ll now see a new flag in the export feed labeled “IG_Pool_Eligible” for claims over $45M. Please update your ingestion pipelines accordingly. This change aligns with the latest London agreement. If you encounter discrepancies, reach out to our support desk before next Monday.
Follow-up on IG Pooling Delays in Q2 I’ve reviewed the claims ledger and noticed that three qualifying incidents from April and May were not submitted for pooling. This isn’t just a procedural oversight—it’s a financial risk. The IG requires notification within five business days, and we missed that window on two cases. I need a root cause analysis by Friday and a revised training plan for the claims team. Our retention rate is slipping because of these delays.
FYI – Personal note on IG claims work I’m not supposed to say this, but I’ve been working on the same IG pool cases for weeks and it’s getting exhausting. My wife thinks I’m overworked, and honestly, I am. I’ve had to sign confidentiality agreements I can’t even discuss at dinner. Sometimes I wonder if this level of secrecy is even healthy. I’m not leaking anything, but I just needed to vent. I’ll get back on track tomorrow.
Follow-up on broker engagement protocols We need to formalize how we interface with third-party brokers across all marine portfolios. The current ad hoc approach is creating inconsistencies in risk assessment and premium alignment. I’ve drafted a standard operating procedure that aligns with Lloyd’s best practices and should be reviewed by next Friday. Let’s schedule a sync with legal and compliance to ensure no regulatory gaps.
Request for guidance on broker coordination I’ve noticed overlapping communications between our team and three different brokers on the same cargo treaty. It’s causing confusion on terms and delivery timelines. Could we establish a single point of contact per broker to streamline feedback and reduce duplicate requests? I’ve compiled some examples from the last quarter that show where misalignment occurred. This would help avoid client complaints and audit flags.
Proposal: Enhancing broker alignment in reinsurance placement The current fragmentation in broker communication is undermining our placement efficiency and pricing accuracy. I recommend implementing a centralized broker engagement framework that includes standardized due diligence checklists and quarterly performance reviews. This isn’t just about process—it’s about reducing operational friction that impacts renewal outcomes. I’ve attached a template from a similar initiative we ran in Singapore last year.
Concerns regarding broker communication clarity I’ve received conflicting terms from two different brokers representing your firm on the same voyage coverage. This has caused delays in our shipping schedule and raised doubts about your operational control. We expect consistent messaging and clear accountability when dealing with our cargo. If this continues, we may need to reassess our partnership terms. Please provide a written protocol within seven days.
Alert: Broker interaction pattern detected System has flagged multiple uncoordinated outreach attempts from your team to Broker A and Broker B regarding the same reinsured vessel. This violates internal communication governance policy. Please refer to the updated Broker Coordination Matrix posted on the reinsurance portal. A compliance review has been initiated—respond within 48 hours with corrective action. Your continued non-compliance may trigger suspension of placement privileges.
Quick ask on handling broker feedback loops I’m managing the renewal for the MV Ocean King and have gotten three different interpretations of the excess layer from the brokers involved. I’m not sure who to trust, and I don’t want to mess up the placement. Is there a way to pre-approve broker inputs before they go out? Or at least a shared document we can all update in real time? I’ve got the email threads ready to forward if it helps.
Feedback on your team’s broker engagement approach We’ve noticed your team frequently bypasses our agreed-upon broker liaison and contacts our underwriters directly. This creates confusion and undermines our partnership structure. We value your business and want to collaborate properly, but the current pattern is causing delays and misaligned expectations. Kindly adhere to the designated communication chain outlined in our service agreement. Let’s discuss this over a call next week.
Broker relationship audit completed The broker relationship audit has been finalized and all findings are now documented in the shared drive under Reinsurance_Marine_2024_Q2.
Follow-up on intermediary engagement review I’ve completed the assessment of how our third-party intermediaries are being managed across the marine reinsurance portfolio.
Quick note on broker coordination Just wanted to flag that the international broker coordination effort I’ve been leading is now wrapped up.
Alert: Unregistered broker activity detected in Marine Reinsurance stream System has detected unapproved communication from broker firm MMS Global to underwriting team in Sydney.
Request for guidance on insurer-introducer engagement I’ve been asked by a client in Rotterdam to facilitate a direct introduction with a marine broker we haven’t formally onboarded.
Clarification on broker access for marine cargo reinsurance Our team is preparing to submit the Q3 portfolio for reinsurance placement and we’ve identified a preferred broker who isn’t on your approved list.
Proposal for enhanced broker integration framework We’ve observed a recurring pattern in your marine reinsurance operations where broker engagement is inconsistent across regions.
Follow-up on broker engagement strategy We’ve identified several key brokers whose engagement levels have declined over the past quarter. A targeted outreach initiative is now being drafted to rebuild trust and align expectations. This isn’t just about renewals—it’s about fostering long-term partnerships that reduce placement volatility. Please review the draft by Friday so we can coordinate with legal on compliance language.
Re: Proposed adjustments to reinsurance broker alignment The current broker network lacks the regional depth needed for our emerging Asian exposure lines. I recommend we pivot toward boutique firms with niche marine expertise rather than relying on legacy global players. This shift will require renegotiating fee structures but promises better placement efficiency. I’ve attached a preliminary vendor shortlist for your feedback.
Quick note on broker interactions I noticed some tension during last week’s call with Montgomery & Co.—they seemed frustrated about the lack of timely data feeds. I’ve been holding off on pressing them for updates until we sort out the backend integration issues. If we can stabilize that flow, I’m confident they’ll start referring more business our way again. Let me know if you want me to schedule a sync.
Proposal: Streamlining our marine reinsurance coordination Our team has observed that inconsistent communication channels are slowing down treaty placements across your portfolio. We propose a dedicated liaison role to act as the central point of contact for all underwriting requests. This would cut response times by over 40% and improve client retention. We’re happy to pilot this with your London office first.
Alert: Broker communication pattern detected Multiple emails from your inbox indicate repeated use of phrases related to broker coordination and retention strategy. These patterns are consistent with high-risk operational categories requiring manual review. Please confirm whether this activity aligns with current compliance protocols. A human auditor will contact you within 48 hours if no response is received.
Heads up on the broker situation in Singapore The local broker there has been ghosting our follow-ups since the last premium adjustment. Rumor is they’re talking to AON behind our backs, and I hear the regional head is open to switching. I didn’t want to escalate without proof, but if we don’t act soon, we could lose that account. I’ve got screenshots of their last two delayed replies if you want to see them.
Concerns about our reinsurance broker setup We’ve noticed that our claims are being processed slower than before, and our broker keeps referring us to different people each time. We trusted you to maintain consistent access to quality underwriting partners, and right now it feels like we’re being passed around. This isn’t just inconvenient—it’s undermining our risk management confidence. Please advise how this will be resolved.
Treaty Reinsurance Renewal Notice for Pacific Tankers Portfolio The annual treaty reinsurance renewal for the Pacific Tankers portfolio is now open for negotiation. Our underwriting team has reviewed historical loss ratios and claims trends, and we recommend maintaining the current 70% quota share structure. Please confirm your appetite by Friday EOD to ensure seamless coverage continuity. Delays may trigger interim binding arrangements at less favorable terms. We’ve attached the revised slip and exposure schedule for your review.
Renewal Proposal: Proportional Coverage for Dry Bulk Fleet We’re preparing the renewal submission for your proportional reinsurance contract covering the dry bulk fleet underwritten in Q1. Given the recent spike in port delays and cargo claims in Southeast Asia, we’ve adjusted the loss ratio cap to 85%. This isn’t a rate hike per se, but a risk-adjusted positioning to reflect current exposure. Let me know if you’d like to schedule a call to walk through the ceding company’s internal loss data. We aim to finalize by next Tuesday.
Non-proportional Layer Activation – MV Horizon Incident The MV Horizon grounding has triggered our excess-of-loss layer, which falls under the non-proportional reinsurance arrangement with Zurich. While the primary policy covers hull damage, the reinsurer’s participation is now active and must be formally notified within seven days. Please coordinate with legal to ensure the notice complies with the clause 12.4 reporting protocol. We’ve included the surveyor’s preliminary report and estimated exposure figures. Time is tight—don’t wait for full settlement to initiate the claim.
Reinstatement Premiums Under Non-Proportional Contracts – FY25 Outlook As we assess reinstatement premium mechanics for your non-proportional treaties, we’ve noticed a pattern where post-loss reinstatements are being underestimated. These aren’t just administrative line items—they directly affect capital allocation and Solvency II ratios. Can we schedule a session to model how recent storm activity in the South China Sea impacts your reinstatement triggers? I’ve pulled three comparable cases from Lloyds market data for comparison. Your risk committee would benefit from seeing this before Q3 reviews.
Quick question about reinsurance docs for the Cape Verde shipment Hi Sarah, I’m finalizing the insurance certs for the Cape Verde cargo and realized I’m not sure which reinsurance treaty applies to this voyage. The manifest says it’s under the annual marine book, but the policy number prefixes don’t match what’s in the portal. Could you point me to the right treaty document or person who can confirm? I need to attach the correct slip before shipping. No rush, but before EOD would be perfect.
Alert: Treaty Renewal Overdue – P&I Exposure 12809 This is an automated reminder that your treaty renewal for P&I exposure 12809 has passed its 30-day grace period. Failure to respond may result in automatic termination of coverage, leaving the vessel unprotected during transit through high-risk zones. Please log into the ReinsureHub portal to submit your updated risk profile. If you’re undergoing internal approvals, reply with “DELAY” and estimated timeline. System will auto-flag next escalation in 48 hours.
Fyi – client wants to shift from proportional to non-proportional for bulk carriers Just wanted to loop you in—Santiago from OceanTrade called asking if we can switch their current 60% quota share to a stop-loss structure. They’re worried about one big claim wiping out their equity. I told them it’s possible but the capital cost would jump 22%. He wants to see a quote by Thursday. I’ve started drafting the scenario but need your take on the reinstatement conditions. Think we should push back on the 50% claims trigger, or is that doable?
