Need a quiet day tomorrow I'm feeling down today and can't seem to shake it. It’s not just fatigue — it’s like a weight I can’t put down. I’ve tried to push through but my focus is gone and I’m making mistakes I wouldn’t normally make. I’m not asking for time off, just a single quiet day to reset. I’ll catch up first thing Monday. I appreciate your understanding.
Can we talk later? I’ve been carrying a lot lately and it’s starting to show — I’m just not myself anymore. The constant pressure has left me drained and emotionally numb. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I need to speak with someone before this gets worse. I’ve been crying in the bathroom during lunch for the past week. I’m not okay, and I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak.
Personal note — please don’t share Lately I’ve been hollow inside, like I’m going through the motions but nothing feels real. I haven’t slept properly in over two weeks and I keep forgetting simple things. It’s not depression, I tell myself — but I know that’s what it is. I’m scared to say it out loud because I don’t want to be seen as unreliable. I just need to know someone’s listening.
Re: Wellbeing Check-In I understand you’ve been under a lot of strain lately, and I want you to know your feelings are valid and seen. Emotional exhaustion doesn’t make you less capable — it makes you human. We have confidential counselling sessions available if you’d like to talk with someone trained to help. No one needs to know you used them except you. Your well-being matters more than productivity metrics.
Following up on your recent message You mentioned feeling overwhelmed last week, and I want to check in properly. It’s not weakness to admit you’re carrying too much — it’s a sign you’re trying to do right by everyone. I’ve adjusted your deadlines for the next two weeks. Please take a long lunch, even if you just sit outside. You don’t owe us your peace. We need you whole, not burnt out.
You good? I noticed you’ve been quiet lately and I just want to say I’m here if you want to vent. I’ve been there — that heavy, numb feeling where even getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. It’s okay to not be okay. I don’t need details, but I’ll bring you coffee tomorrow if you’re up for it. You’re not alone in this, even if it feels like it.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been going through a rough patch lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I don’t feel like myself anymore, and the weight of everything has been hard to carry alone. I’m not asking for much, just a few days to reset and get my head straight. I know the team is stretched thin, but I truly need this to come back stronger. I’ll make sure everything’s covered before I go.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I understand you’ve been coping with a difficult personal transition, and I want to acknowledge how tough that can be. Many of our team members have gone through similar moments, and it’s important we support each other through them. Your honesty in reaching out is appreciated, and we’re here to help with counseling resources if you’d like. Please don’t hesitate to lean on us—your wellbeing matters just as much as your role here.
Checking in after your last week I noticed you’ve seemed quieter and more withdrawn over the past few weeks, and I wanted to reach out with care, not pressure. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know I’ve noticed the shift and I care. If you need space, flexibility, or even just someone to listen, my door is open. You’re not alone in this, and your value here doesn’t disappear because life gets heavy.
Just wanted to say thanks for your patience Lately I’ve been struggling to stay on top of things and I know it’s been obvious to everyone. It’s not laziness—it’s just been hard to find joy in anything since things fell apart at home. I’m slowly getting better, but I wanted to thank you for not making me feel like I’m falling behind. Your kindness has meant more than I can say.
Can we talk? I haven’t been the same since I lost her. Some days I get out of bed, some days I just stare at the ceiling. It’s not something I talk about at work, but I’ve started crying in the bathroom again and I’m scared I’ll be found out. I don’t expect you to fix it—just wanted you to know I’m not okay, and I don’t know how to ask for help.
Regarding your wellbeing survey response Your anonymous feedback mentioned feeling emotionally drained and disconnected from your workplace environment. I want to assure you this isn’t uncommon after major life events, and your honesty helps us improve support systems. We’re rolling out confidential peer networks and mental health days next quarter—please consider joining. You deserve to feel safe and supported, even when private pain makes it hard to speak up.
Request for private chat when you have a moment I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal stuff and I’m worried it’s impacting my performance. I’ve been trying to push through, but lately I just feel hollow, like I’m going through the motions. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m reaching out because I need to know if there’s a way to talk without judgment. I’m not looking for pity—just a little breathing room.
Need some time off — I’m not okay I’ve been struggling to get through the day lately and I don’t know how to say it out loud. I feel completely drained, like I’m carrying a weight I can’t name. I used to love my work, but now I just wake up dreading it. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a few days to breathe without judgment. I know it’s not easy to hear, but I need to be honest before I break.
Follow up on your recent check-in Thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling — it took courage to open up. Many people carry this alone because they think it’s a sign of weakness, but it’s not. You’re not alone in this, and we have resources to support you through this. Please consider speaking with our EAP counselor this week — no pressure, just a quiet space to talk. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been feeling hollow lately, like I’m going through the motions but not really living. I don’t have the words to explain it to my team, and I’m scared of being seen as unreliable. I’ve stopped texting friends because I don’t want to burden anyone. I’m not crying at my desk anymore, but I’m not sleeping either. I need help, but I don’t know where to start.
Checking in — I noticed you’ve been quiet I’ve observed you’ve withdrawn a bit over the past few weeks, and I want you to know I’m here, not as your boss but as someone who cares. You don’t have to perform cheerfulness here, especially when you’re carrying something heavy. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or just emotionally spent, we can adjust your load temporarily. I’ve seen too many good people burn out silently.
I need to talk — it’s about more than work I’ve been fighting myself to get out of bed every morning, and I’m tired of pretending I’m fine. I used to be the one who encouraged others, but now I can’t even muster a smile. I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding dramatic or weak. I’ve started staying late on purpose just to avoid going home to an empty house. I’m scared I’m failing at everything.
Support resources for your team members I’ve worked with teams across Europe and North America where burnout manifests not as anger but as silence. Many employees feel shame about emotional exhaustion, especially when they’re expected to be resilient. If someone on your team seems detached, withdrawn, or unusually fatigued, it might not be laziness — it might be depression. I’ve seen direct interventions reduce turnover by 40% when handled with empathy.
Just checking in — how are you really? I noticed you’ve stopped calling on Sundays, and I miss hearing your voice. Are you sleeping? Have you eaten anything that wasn’t instant noodles this week? I know you hate talking about feelings, but I’m not asking for a summary — I’m asking if you’re still in there. You don’t have to fix yourself before you tell me you’re hurting. I’m not going anywhere.
Need some time off this week I’ve been struggling to get through each day since I relocated last month. The isolation has gotten worse than I expected, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I’d really appreciate a few days to reset and reconnect with myself. I’m not sick, just emotionally drained, and I need to address this before it impacts my performance further.
Checking in on your well-being I noticed you’ve been quieter in team meetings lately, and I wanted to check in. Moving to a new place alone can be incredibly tough, especially when you’re adjusting to a new role too. I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay, and if you need flexible hours or counseling resources, HR has support available. Your mental health matters just as much as your output.
Confidential support options available We’ve received anonymous feedback that some team members are experiencing emotional strain after relocation. If you’ve been feeling persistently down, anxious, or disconnected since your move, we encourage you to reach out to our Employee Assistance Program. These services are completely confidential and available 24/7. You’re not alone, and we’re here to help without judgment.
You’re not the only one I moved to the same city last year and thought I’d be fine—turns out I was just putting on a brave face. I spent weeks feeling numb, like I didn’t belong anywhere. I started going to a small expat gathering on Sundays, and it helped more than I thought. If you ever want to grab coffee and just talk, I’m here. No pressure, just company.
Request for private conversation I’ve been dealing with a lot personally since my transfer, and I’m finding it harder to keep up with deadlines. It’s not laziness—it’s that I wake up every morning with this heavy feeling I can’t shake. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’d be grateful for any accommodations you might suggest. I’m trying to get better, but it’s slow.
Follow-up on wellbeing survey responses Several respondents mentioned persistent low mood after relocation, particularly those without local support networks. While this isn’t a formal medical concern, it’s affecting retention and engagement metrics. I recommend we pilot a silent check-in system where managers respond with resources, not questions. Sometimes people just need to feel seen, not solved.
I’m worried about you I noticed your last video call was really quiet—you didn’t even smile when I told the joke about the cat. I know you said you’re fine, but I’ve seen this before. You’re not sleeping, you’re not eating right, and you’re canceling plans you used to look forward to. Please, let me help you find someone to talk to here. I love you too much to watch this continue.
Need some time off this week I’ve been struggling to get through the day without completely burning out. The workload has intensified, and I just can’t shake this constant sense of being overwhelmed. I know it’s not ideal, but I need a few days to reset before I make a mistake that affects the team.
Following up on your last message I noticed you mentioned feeling down lately during our check-in, and I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. If you’re finding it hard to focus or just need to step back for a bit, we can absolutely adjust your deadlines. Your well-being matters more than any deliverable.
Confidential support resources available We’re reaching out because our records indicate you’ve been facing some personal challenges recently. You’re not alone, and we have confidential counseling services available through our EAP program. Many employees find talking to a neutral professional helps them regain clarity and manage pressure.
Can we talk tomorrow? Lately I’ve been carrying this heavy weight that’s making it hard to sleep or even start my day. I don’t want to be seen as weak, but I’m barely holding it together. I don’t need solutions right now—just someone to listen before I spiral further.
Just checking in I know you’ve been swamped, and honestly, I’ve been there too. Sometimes it’s not about the project—it’s just your brain refusing to turn off the noise. If you ever want to grab coffee or just vent without judgment, I’m here. You don’t have to put on a brave face with me.
Request for flexibility on upcoming deadlines I’ve been dealing with a personal slump that’s making concentration nearly impossible, even though I’m putting in the hours. I’m not asking for less work—I’m asking for a little more breathing room until I regain my footing. I promise I won’t let this impact quality, just pace.
Hope you’re taking care of yourself Mum said you’ve been quiet lately and not sleeping well. I know work is tough, but you’ve always pushed yourself too hard. Please don’t ignore how you’re feeling just because you think you should be “stronger.” I’d rather hear you say you’re broken than pretend you’re fine.
Need some time off – feeling drained I’ve been holding it together for weeks, but I’m really struggling to keep up with everything. The weight of deadlines and personal obligations has become too much to handle on my own. I don’t want to fall behind, but I also can’t keep pushing myself to the point of burnout. Could we talk about adjusting my workload for a bit? I’m not asking for a vacation, just a little breathing room.
Following up on your recent message I noticed you mentioned feeling overwhelmed during our last check-in, and I want you to know I take that seriously. Your contributions are valued, but your well-being matters just as much. If you need to temporarily reduce non-critical tasks or reassign some deliverables, let me know what would help most. I’m not expecting you to power through this alone.
Support resources available – confidential We’ve received your request regarding emotional strain, and I want to assure you this is handled with complete discretion. Many of our employees experience periods where responsibilities feel unmanageable, and that’s exactly why we offer free counseling sessions and flexible scheduling. You’re not alone, and reaching out was the right step. Please consider booking a session this week — it’s anonymous and completely voluntary.
I’m just not myself lately Lately, I’ve been exhausted even after a full night’s sleep, and it’s affecting my focus at work. I’ve been avoiding team calls because I can’t muster the energy to pretend I’m fine. It’s not just the workload — it’s the constant pressure to perform while managing things at home. I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak, but I need to.
Hey, just checking in I know you’ve been juggling a ton lately, and I just wanted to say I see you. I went through something similar last year — feeling like I was drowning in small tasks until one day I just broke down crying at my desk. It’s not weakness to admit you’re stretched too thin. If you want to grab coffee tomorrow and vent, I’m free. No judgment, just listening.
Re: Wellbeing Check-In (Confidential) As part of our ongoing employee wellness initiative, I’m reaching out to see how you’re coping with your current responsibilities. It’s not uncommon for professionals to feel emotionally drained when personal and professional demands collide. You’re not expected to compartmentalize perfectly — and if you’re feeling the weight of multiple roles, that’s valid. Our confidential portal has guided journaling tools and stress assessments you can complete anytime.
Can we talk about my hours? I’ve been holding down two jobs — one here and one on the side — just to make ends meet, and it’s taking a toll. I’m not sleeping well, I’m snapping at people, and I can’t remember the last time I had a full day off. I don’t want to quit, but I also can’t keep going like this. I’m not asking for more pay — just fewer evening emails and no weekend requests. Is that possible?
Need some time off this week I’ve been struggling to get through each day since my cat passed last month. The loneliness has hit harder than I expected, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I know it’s not a medical emergency, but I need a few days to grieve properly and reset. I’d appreciate your understanding and any flexibility you can offer.
Checking in after your recent absence I noticed you’ve been quieter lately and wanted to check in. I’ve seen how much your dog meant to you, and I’m sorry for your loss. It’s okay to take time to heal—even if it doesn’t look like a typical sick day. Please let me know if you need more space or support navigating this.
Employee Assistance Program reminder If you’re going through a tough time after the loss of a pet or loved one, our EAP offers free counseling sessions seven days a week. Many employees find it helps to talk to someone neutral when grief affects daily function. You don’t need to wait until you’re overwhelmed to reach out—we’re here before the stress becomes unmanageable.
Just wanted to say I’m not myself right now I’ve been carrying a heavy weight since my bird died last week. I barely slept last night and kept crying at my desk, which I know isn’t professional, but I can’t seem to shake it. I’m not asking for leave, just hoping you notice I’m not being lazy—I’m just hurting. I’ll get back to normal soon, I think.
I’m sorry I’ve been distant I’ve been so consumed with sadness since we lost Max that I haven’t called you back or answered texts. It feels like part of me is gone, and I don’t know how to explain it to anyone at work. I’m trying to be strong, but some days I just sit and stare at his empty bowl. I’m sorry I’ve been so quiet.
Re: Wellbeing follow-up from last week’s session During our chat, you mentioned how losing your horse has left you feeling adrift. That kind of grief often goes unnoticed in professional settings, but it’s valid and deeply affecting. Many clients in your position benefit from structured check-ins during high-emotion periods. Would you be open to scheduling another session this week?
Can we talk about workload? I’ve been trying to keep up, but the last few weeks have been brutal—I just lost my best friend, and the silence at home is crushing. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little more time on the Henderson project. I know it’s not ideal, but I’m doing my best under circumstances no one sees. I promise I’ll catch up once I’m steadier.
Need some time off this month I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because I’m going through a really tough emotional patch. The holidays are bringing up a lot of loneliness I hadn’t expected, and I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m not asking for much—just a few days to reset and reconnect with people who care. I know it’s busy, but I really need this to get back on track.
Following up on your recent note I noticed you mentioned feeling overwhelmed during your check-in last week, and I want you to know I take that seriously. It’s okay to not be okay, especially with everything happening outside work. Please consider using your EAP benefits—I’ve personally found them helpful during high-stress periods. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now.
Reminder: Confidential Emotional Support Resources Available If you’ve been feeling down, isolated, or emotionally drained lately, you’re not alone, and help is available without judgment. Our confidential counseling service is staffed by licensed professionals who specialize in seasonal emotional challenges. You don’t need to disclose anything to your manager to access these sessions—your privacy is guaranteed. Many employees have found this support life-changing during the winter months.
Can we talk tomorrow? I’ve been carrying a heavy weight lately and I’m not sure how much longer I can keep pretending everything’s fine. Work feels impossible when your mind is stuck in a loop of hopelessness and exhaustion. I’m scared to say it out loud, but I think I need help—and I trust you enough to ask. I’ll be in your office at 10 if you’re free.
Just checking in… I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. This time of year hits harder than people admit, especially when you’re far from home. You don’t have to explain anything, but I’m here if you just want to sit in silence or cry or talk about nothing. You mean too much to me to lose you to this.
Supporting team wellbeing during Q4 Many of our clients report a spike in emotional distress as year-end pressures mount and social isolation increases. It’s not just about burnout—it’s grief, loss, and unmet emotional needs disguised as low productivity. We recommend managers initiate low-pressure check-ins that normalize vulnerability, not performance metrics. This isn’t a HR formality; it’s human maintenance.
Request for flexible days next week I’ve been dealing with a prolonged low mood that’s making it hard to focus, even though I’m trying to push through. It’s not laziness—it’s a mental heaviness I can’t shake, and I’m worried it’s starting to affect my work quality. I’d be grateful if I could work from home two days and shift my hours to better match my energy. I promise I’ll meet all deliverables, just need a little breathing room.
Need some time off I've been feeling depressed for weeks and need support. It’s affecting my focus at work, and I’m struggling to keep up with deadlines. I don’t want to make this a big deal, but I think I need to take a few days to reset. I’m happy to provide a doctor’s note if required.
Feeling overwhelmed lately Lately, I’ve been carrying a heavy emotional load that’s hard to shake off. The constant pressure has left me drained, and I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’ve tried talking to friends, but it’s not enough — I need to speak with someone who can help me navigate this. I’m not asking for special treatment, just some understanding and maybe a temporary adjustment.
Following up on your wellbeing I noticed you’ve seemed quieter than usual over the past month, and I want to check in. You don’t have to share anything if you’re not ready, but I’m here if you want to talk about what’s going on. Sometimes these things build up silently, and I’d hate for you to think you have to handle it alone. HR has confidential resources available if that feels easier.
You okay? I know you’ve been juggling a lot lately and I just wanted to say I’ve noticed you’re not your usual self. I’ve been there before — feeling like you’re sinking and no one gets it. I don’t have all the answers, but I’m free for coffee this week if you want to vent. No judgment, no pressure, just a listening ear.
Confidential wellbeing check-in As part of our employee care initiative, I’m reaching out to see how you’re managing emotionally outside of work. Many of us experience low periods that impact our daily functioning, even if we mask it well. Our EAP program offers free, private counseling sessions — no paperwork, no manager notification. You deserve support, and you’re not alone in this.
Request for flexible schedule I’ve been going through a really tough time emotionally, and it’s becoming harder to maintain my usual hours. I’m not sick, but I’m exhausted in a way that medication or rest alone won’t fix. I’m asking if I could adjust my start time to 10 AM for the next month, just so I can get through the day without falling apart. I’ll make sure all my output stays on track.
Personal note — not for HR files I’ve been feeling really lonely and hopeless since the team restructuring. The isolation has gotten worse, and I’m afraid if I say anything, people will think I’m not resilient enough. I don’t know who else to turn to — I just need someone to tell me it’s okay to not be okay. If you ever feel the same, please reach out. I won’t tell anyone.
Need some time off — I’m struggling I’ve been feeling really down lately and it’s starting to affect my work. I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this at home or here, and it’s getting harder to get out of bed in the morning. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a few days to regroup and reset. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I need to prioritize my mental health before things get worse.
Checking in — I noticed you’ve been quiet lately I’ve observed you’ve been withdrawing during team meetings and seem less engaged than usual. I want you to know it’s okay to share if something’s weighing on you — we’re a team, not just colleagues. If you need space or support, HR has confidential resources available. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Confidential support options — your well-being matters We’ve noticed a pattern of low engagement from your recent activity logs and want to reach out gently. Many employees experience periods of isolation or emotional strain, even when they appear fine on the surface. You’re not alone, and we offer free, anonymous counseling through our EAP program. No one needs to know you reached out unless you choose to tell them.
Hey, you good? I know you’ve been keeping to yourself lately and I just wanted to say I’ve noticed. I’ve been there — that heavy, hollow feeling like no one really gets it. You don’t have to explain anything, but I’m here if you want to grab coffee or just sit in silence. Sometimes just knowing someone sees you helps more than words.
Request to speak privately — personal matter I hope you don’t mind me asking for a quiet moment to talk. Lately I’ve been overwhelmed by how alone I feel, even though I’m surrounded by people. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m finding it hard to focus and I think I need to talk to someone trained. I’d appreciate it if this stays between us.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve heard the tone in your voice and it’s not the same. You used to call every Sunday — now it’s weeks between messages. I don’t know what’s going on, but I miss you. You don’t have to go through this by yourself. I’m here, no matter how messy it feels.
Follow-up on well-being check-in During our last session, you mentioned feeling emotionally drained with little support at home or work. Many professionals in your position experience this without realizing it’s not normal. You’re not failing — you’re human. Our next step could be connecting you with a certified counselor who specializes in workplace isolation. Would you be open to that?
Need to talk about my current state I’m feeling stressed out and need someone to listen. It’s been weeks since I’ve slept properly, and I’m starting to lose grip on my work quality. I don’t want to make excuses, but I genuinely can’t keep going like this without support. Can we schedule a time this week to talk?
Feeling overwhelmed at work I’ve been holding it together for a while now, but I’m at a breaking point. The constant deadlines and lack of bandwidth have left me emotionally drained. I’m not sleeping, I’m snapping at colleagues, and I know I’m not performing at my best. I need to talk to someone who understands—just to offload this weight.
Following up on your recent note I noticed you mentioned you’ve been struggling emotionally lately, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You’re not expected to be okay all the time, especially with the workload we’ve piled on. I’m arranging for you to speak with our EAP counselor next week—no questions asked. Your well-being matters more than any deliverable right now.
Private check-in re: your recent absence I understand you’ve been dealing with some personal challenges that aren’t easy to discuss openly. Many of our employees go through phases like this, and you shouldn’t feel ashamed for reaching out. Our confidential support line is always available, and I’ve already flagged your file for a gentle follow-up. You’re not alone in this.
Just checking in… I’ve noticed you’ve been quiet lately, and I don’t think it’s just the usual Monday blues. I’ve been there—when the weight of everything feels like it’s crushing you and you don’t know who to tell. If you want to grab coffee or just sit in silence, I’m here. No judgment. No pressure. Just someone who gets it.
Can I take a day off? It’s personal I’m not well enough to be productive today, and I’m not going to pretend I am. The anxiety has been building for weeks, and I’m reaching a point where I can’t even focus on simple tasks. I know this isn’t ideal timing, but I need to step away before I break down in front of the team. I’ll send a full update tomorrow if I’m able.
I’m really worried about you I’ve noticed you’ve been cancelling calls and not answering texts for days. You used to talk so openly, but now you just say “I’m fine” and hang up. I know how hard work has been lately, and I can hear it in your voice even when you don’t say it. Please don’t keep this to yourself—I care, and I’m here whether you want to cry, scream, or just sit quietly together.
Need some time off – things are really heavy right now I’ve been struggling to get through each day lately, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. The loss of my mother last month has left me without a sense of direction, and I don’t know how to pull myself out of this fog. I’m not asking for much—just a few days to breathe and reset without feeling like I’m letting everyone down.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I understand you’re navigating a deeply personal chapter right now, and I want to assure you our support is available without judgment. Many of our team members have faced similar struggles with grief and isolation, and you’re not alone in this. Please let me know if you’d like to connect with our counseling partner or adjust your workload temporarily.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been quiet the past week, and I wanted to reach out personally, not just as your manager but as someone who cares. You’ve always been so resilient, but I know this isn’t just a bad week—it’s been weighing on you for months. If you need space to process or someone to listen, I’m here.
Can we talk about my schedule? Lately I’ve been drained in ways I can’t explain, and it’s harder to get out of bed some mornings. The pressure to appear “fine” at work makes it worse, but I’m not okay, and I don’t want to fake it anymore. I’m not sure what I need yet, but I think I need help before I burn out completely.
I don’t know how to say this… I’ve been carrying this alone for too long, and I’m terrified I’m falling apart without anyone noticing. Nothing feels right anymore—not my sleep, not my appetite, not even the smallest joys I used to love. I don’t expect you to fix it, but I need to know I can be honest with you without being told to “just snap out of it.”
Request for private conversation re: workplace well-being As an external advisor, I’ve observed subtle signs that several team members are silently managing emotional exhaustion. It’s not about productivity—it’s about human resilience being stretched thin. I’d like to propose a confidential, optional session for those who feel trapped in their own heads but can’t speak up at work.
I’m not okay—sorry I haven’t said so before I’ve been pretending I’m fine because I don’t want to be seen as weak, but the truth is I’m barely holding on. The weight of losing my partner last year still crushes me every morning, and I haven’t told anyone. I need to adjust my hours, maybe work from home more, just so I don’t collapse in the bathroom again.
Need a day off — just not feeling right I'm feeling down and just want to cry. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for days and every morning feels heavier than the last. I know I’ve been quiet in meetings, but I’m not ignoring anything — I’m just exhausted in a way I can’t explain. If it’s possible, I’d really appreciate a personal day to reset. I’ll make sure everything is covered before I go.
Can we talk sometime this week? Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of weight that I don’t know how to put into words. I’ve been struggling to find joy in things that used to light me up, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I don’t want to seem weak, but I need someone to listen, not fix. I’ve been seeing a counsellor, but having this space at work would help me feel less alone. Thank you for considering this.
Just checking in I’ve been really low lately and I think I’ve been masking it too well. I’ve spent hours just staring at my screen, unable to start anything, and I keepCanceling plans because I can’t face being around people. It’s not that I’m busy — it’s that I’m hollow inside. I don’t expect you to fix me, but I’m glad we’re still in touch.
Follow-up on your well-being check-in I noticed you mentioned feeling emotionally drained during our last conversation and I wanted to check in gently. Many of us go through periods where the weight of daily life becomes hard to carry, and it’s okay to say that out loud. You’re not a burden for needing space — in fact, recognizing this is a sign of strength. Please let me know if you’d like help connecting with our Employee Assistance Program.
Quick chat about your recent work patterns I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter in team syncs and your deliverables have slowed, and I want to make sure you’re okay. I’m not raising this because I’m concerned about output — I’m concerned about you. Life doesn’t pause because we’re at work, and if something’s weighing on you, I’m here to listen without judgment. You don’t have to share details, but I hope you know support is available.
I’m not sure how to ask this… There’s been a quiet collapse inside me over the last few weeks, and I don’t trust myself to handle anything that requires more than basic focus. I’ve been crying in the bathroom stall after lunch and I hate that it’s come to this. I’m scared to say it out loud because I worry people will think I’m unfit for my role. But I need to say it: I’m not okay, and I don’t know how to fix it alone.
Re: Your confidential request for support Thank you for trusting me with this — I know it took courage. What you’re describing — the numbness, the isolation, the sense of sinking — is more common than most people admit, especially in high-pressure roles. Your mental health isn’t a performance metric, and it never will be. I’ve arranged two sessions with our workplace counsellor next week. You don’t have to explain anything — just show up. You’re valued here, even on the days you feel like you’re not enough.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been going through a rough patch lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I don’t feel like myself anymore, and the weight of everything has been hard to carry alone. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I’m hoping you might understand and allow me a few days to regroup. This isn’t something I want to discuss in detail, but I need space to breathe.
Follow-up on your recent well-being note Thank you for sharing how isolated you’ve been feeling lately — your honesty matters. Many employees go through similar struggles but rarely speak up, so please know you’re not alone. Our EAP program is available 24/7 for confidential counseling, and I’ve already sent you the link. If you’d prefer to talk in person, I’m available any morning this week.
Checking in about your recent performance dip I’ve noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past couple of weeks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. You’ve always been reliable, and it’s not like you to miss deadlines or skip team lunches. If there’s anything going on outside of work that’s weighing on you, I’m here to listen — no judgment, no pressure. We can adjust your workload if needed.
Can we talk? I’m not coping well I’ve been battling a deep sense of emptiness that I can’t shake, even after weekends and time off. It’s not just tiredness — I feel like I’ve lost my footing and don’t know how to ask for help. I don’t want this to impact my job, but I’m struggling to keep up. Could we schedule a quiet chat this afternoon? I’d appreciate your discretion.
Just wanted to say I’m here I know you haven’t been answering texts lately, and I’m worried. You used to light up when we talked, and now it’s like you’ve shut down inside. It’s okay if you don’t want to explain — I just need you to know I see you and I care. I’m not going anywhere.
Re: Your feedback on workplace culture Many participants in our latest survey mentioned feeling emotionally unsupported during high-stress periods. The absence of psychological safety is leaving people to cope alone, often in silence. I recommend we normalize check-ins that don’t require formal reporting — just human connection. People aren’t machines, and emotional strain doesn’t vanish because it’s unspoken.
Request for flexibility — personal reason I’ve been dealing with a lot of inner turmoil lately and it’s harder to show up as I used to. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little more room to breathe during this season. I’m still meeting deadlines, but my energy is low and my focus is scattered. If I could work remotely two days a week for the next month, it would mean everything.
Need some time off — mental health is slipping I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload lately and it’s starting to affect my sleep and focus. I’m not sleeping well and I keep replaying every mistake in my head. I know the team is stretched thin, but I don’t think I can keep going like this without burning out completely.
Checking in — I noticed you’ve been quiet lately I’ve observed that you’ve withdrawn a bit from team chats and haven’t volunteered for new tasks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. You’re not the only one who’s been under pressure, but I’m worried this isn’t just about workload. If you need to talk, or just need a few days to reset, I’m here to help however I can.
Follow-up on your confidential wellness request Thank you for sharing your concerns during our recent check-in — your honesty is appreciated. Many employees experience periods where stress becomes unmanageable, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. Our EAP program offers free, confidential counseling sessions that you can access anytime, even after hours.
I need to talk — it’s been a rough few weeks I’ve been carrying a lot of weight on my own and I’m not sure how to ask for help without sounding weak. I cry on the way to work sometimes just thinking about the day ahead. I’ve missed meals and skipped breaks because I’m too drained to move. I don’t want this to affect my performance, but I don’t know how to fix it alone.
You good? I’ve been thinking about you I noticed you haven’t joined the Friday coffee calls lately and I just wanted to say I’ve missed your voice. I’ve been going through something similar — feeling stuck and like no one gets it. I don’t need you to fix anything, but if you want to vent over tea or just sit in silence, I’m here.
Re: Your anonymous survey response about workplace stress I reviewed your feedback and want to assure you your experience is valid and shared by many across our client base. The feeling of being trapped under pressure without support is more common than leadership realizes. You deserve space to breathe — I’ve helped others navigate this by starting small, like setting one daily boundary.
Mom’s worried — you haven’t called in weeks I know you’ve been busy with work, but I haven’t heard your laugh in over a month and it scares me. You used to tell me about your days — now your texts are one word. I don’t need details, I just need to know you’re not drowning. Come over Sunday — I’ll make your favorite soup and we won’t talk about anything serious.
I’m struggling to cope right now I haven’t been myself lately and I’m finding it harder to get through each day. I need emotional support more than I ever have before, and I don’t know who else to turn to. It’s not about solving anything—it’s just about having someone listen without judgment. I’m not asking for a fix, just a little space to be heard.
Following up on your recent request I understand you’ve been feeling overwhelmed and isolated at work, and I want you to know your wellbeing matters. You’re not alone in this, and there are confidential resources available through our employee assistance program. Sometimes just talking through what’s weighing on you can make a difference, even if it feels small. I’m here to help you find the right support.
Checking in I noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings lately and I wanted to reach out personally. If you’re going through something difficult, please know it’s okay to say so. You don’t have to carry this alone—not here, not with us. I’m not asking for details, just that you know support is available if you need it.
Can we talk? I’ve been holding it together for weeks, but I’m at a point where I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’m not looking for advice, just someone who won’t rush me or dismiss how I feel. I need to unburden myself to a person who understands, not a policy. I trust you enough to say this—please don’t let this leave this room.
I’m not okay I know this might come out of nowhere, but I’ve been drowning in silence for too long. I need someone to sit with me in this, even if we don’t speak much. I don’t want solutions—I want presence. I’ve never asked for help like this before, but I can’t do it on my own anymore.
A personal note from a fellow traveler I’ve walked through some of the darkest days you’re likely feeling right now, and I wish someone had told me it was okay to ask for a listening ear. You don’t have to be strong all the time. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say you’re broken and need a hand. I’m here if you want to talk—no agenda, no pressure.
Can I ask for something private? I’ve been meaning to bring this up for weeks, but I was afraid it would make me seem weak. I’m not sleeping, I’m not eating right, and I just need someone to hear me without trying to fix it. I know you’re in a position of authority, but I’m asking you as a human, not a boss. I’m not asking for time off—I’m asking for compassion.
Feeling overwhelmed this week I’ve been struggling to keep up with everything lately and I’m not sure how much longer I can manage on my own. I really need someone to talk to who understands what I’m going through, not just about work but life in general. I know it’s not typical to ask this in a professional setting, but I’m at a point where I can’t pretend everything’s fine anymore.
Checking in after your recent time off I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual since you came back, and I want you to know I’m here if you need to talk. Sometimes things outside of work weigh heavier than we let on, and it’s okay to say so. Your well-being matters more than any deadline, and I’d rather you take the space you need than push through in silence.
Resources available for emotional well-being I wanted to reach out because our Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counseling sessions, including after-hours support. Many people hesitate to ask, but reaching out when you’re feeling isolated or emotionally drained is a sign of strength, not weakness. You don’t have to go through this alone, even if it feels like no one else notices.
Can we grab coffee sometime? I’ve been going through a rough patch lately and I miss having people I can just be real with at work. I don’t need advice, just someone to listen without judgment. I know it’s a bit unorthodox to ask a colleague like this, but I trust you and I’d be grateful for even ten minutes.
Follow-up from our session After our conversation yesterday, I’ve been reflecting on how much pressure you’re under, and I want to assure you it’s valid to feel this way. You’re not expected to be a rock for everyone all the time — needing help doesn’t make you less capable. If you’d like, I can connect you with someone who specializes in workplace emotional burnout.
Request for private chat I’ve been dealing with some personal issues that have started affecting my focus, and I’m afraid to bring it up in team meetings. I don’t know how to say it without sounding weak, but I honestly need a safe space to just speak without fear of being misinterpreted. I trust your discretion and would appreciate the chance to talk privately.
I heard you’ve been struggling I know you haven’t told anyone at work, but I’ve seen how tired you look in your calls lately. You don’t have to carry this burden alone, even if you feel like you should. I’ve been thinking about you, and I want you to know it’s okay to ask for help — from us, from HR, from anyone. You’re not broken for needing support.
I’m really struggling right now I don’t know who else to turn to, but I need someone to talk to who won’t judge me. Lately, I’ve been lying awake at night wondering if anyone even notices how heavy I feel. I’m not asking for solutions—just someone to listen, even if it’s just once.
Following up on your recent note I wanted to acknowledge your message about feeling isolated at work. It takes courage to say that, and I want you to know you’re not alone. We have confidential peer support channels and trained counselors available if you’d like to speak with someone. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Checking in I noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings and I wanted to reach out personally. If you’re going through something difficult, I’m here—not as your boss, but as a human being who cares. You don’t have to explain everything, but please know I’m open to listening whenever you’re ready.
Can we talk? I’ve been holding it together at work, but inside I’m falling apart. I don’t have a close circle here, and I miss having someone who just gets it without asking for details. I’m not looking for advice—just companionship, even if it’s over coffee once a week.
A quiet request I’m working remotely and feeling more disconnected than I expected. I know this isn’t part of the contract, but I wonder if you’d be willing to be a sounding board sometimes? I don’t need fixes, just presence. I’ve never admitted this to anyone at work before, but I think I need it.
Personal request, if you have a moment I’ve been trying to manage on my own, but I’m hitting a wall and I don’t know how else to ask. I think I need a friend at work—not someone to fix things, but someone to sit with me in the mess. It’s embarrassing to say, but I’m scared I’m breaking silently.
Thinking of you I know you’ve been putting on a brave face at work, but I can hear it in your voice. You don’t have to be strong all the time. I’m here, and I’ll be your friend even if you’re too tired to talk. I just want you to feel seen, even from afar.
I’m not sure how to handle this I’ve been going through a really tough time lately and I don’t know who else to turn to. What happened last week has left me feeling completely drained and isolated. I need someone to talk to who won’t judge me or try to fix it—just listen. I’m not asking for time off, just a quiet conversation with someone I trust.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed after everything that’s happened, and I want you to know your well-being matters here. You don’t have to go through this alone—we have confidential counseling resources available. If you’re not ready to speak with a professional yet, I’m here to hear you out, no pressure. Your mental health is part of our company’s commitment to you.
Checking in I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual lately and I wanted to reach out personally. You’ve been such a valuable part of the team, and I care about how you’re doing beyond the work. If you want to talk about anything—personal stuff, stress, anything—I’m available this week, even just over coffee. No need to pretend everything’s fine if it’s not.
Can we talk privately? Lately I’ve been struggling to cope with some things that have nothing to do with work but are affecting me deeply. I don’t have a lot of people I feel safe sharing this with, and I’m reaching out because I need support, not advice. I’m not looking for a solution, just a space to be heard without having to explain myself.
Hope you’re okay I heard what happened and I just wanted to say I’m here if you need someone to lean on. You don’t have to be strong all the time, and you don’t owe anyone a smile. If you want to cry, scream, or sit in silence together—I’ll be there. You’ve always been there for me, and now it’s my turn.
Support options for your team Many employees are carrying emotional burdens they never speak about in the open, especially after personal losses or trauma. I recommend creating a safe channel where individuals can express feelings without fear of stigma or professional repercussion. Sometimes all someone needs is to feel seen, not fixed.
Request for a private meeting I’ve had a rough few weeks and I’m finding it hard to focus, not because of workload but because of what’s going on at home. I know it’s not typical to bring personal issues to work, but I don’t have anyone else I can talk to. I’m not asking for special treatment—just a few minutes of your time to unburden myself. I promise I’ll be professional, but I need to say it out loud.
I'm struggling and need help I need emotional support from someone who understands. Lately, I’ve been coming home exhausted and crying just to get through the night. I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending everything’s fine at work. If there’s any confidential resource or person I can talk to, I’d be so grateful.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal stuff lately and I’m finding it hard to function normally. I don’t have anyone close by I feel comfortable opening up to, and the weight is becoming unbearable. I’m not asking for time off — just a safe space to speak without judgment. I’ve never reached out before but I need to now.
Following up on our chat I’ve noticed you haven’t been yourself lately, and I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. Many of us go through periods where just having someone listen makes all the difference. If you’d prefer speaking to someone outside the team, HR has counselors available with full confidentiality. You’re not alone in this.
You okay? I know you’ve been quiet this past week and I just wanted to say I’m here if you need to vent. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed I can’t even find the words, but I know how much it helps to say them out loud. You don’t have to explain everything, just knowing you’re not stuck in it alone matters.
Support options available to you As part of our employee wellness commitment, we offer free, anonymous sessions with licensed emotional support counselors. Many employees use this service during times of stress, grief, or isolation — even if they’re unsure why they’re feeling this way. You don’t need to justify your feelings to access care. Your well-being matters more than you think.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying “I’m fine” every time I call, but your voice sounds hollow lately. You used to love coming home and telling me about your day — now you barely speak. I’m not asking you to fix anything, just to let someone in. I’ll sit with you in silence if that’s what you need.
Confidential wellness check-in I work with organizations to help staff navigate emotional burnout, and I’ve seen too many people suffer in silence because they think it’s a sign of weakness. You don’t have to be broken to deserve support — sometimes you just need to feel heard. If you’re open to a quiet 20-minute call this week, I’m here. No pressure, no paperwork.
I’m struggling to keep up lately I’ve been going through a really tough time personally, and I don’t know who else to turn to. I need someone to talk to who won’t judge me or treat me differently at work. It’s not just about stress—it’s loneliness and feeling like no one understands what I’m carrying inside. I’m not asking for time off, just a little space to be heard.
Follow-up on your recent check-in I want to thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling—it takes courage to speak up. Many employees hesitate to mention they’re craving emotional support, but you’re not alone in this. Our Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counseling sessions, and I can connect you with a counselor today if you’d like. You deserve to feel supported, not just as a worker but as a person.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual the past couple weeks, and I wanted to reach out unofficially. If you’re going through something heavy and need a listening ear, I’m here—not as your boss, but as someone who cares. Sometimes people just need a friend to get through the fog, even if it’s on a lunch break. No pressure to explain anything, but I’m not going to pretend I haven’t noticed.
Can we talk? I’ve been holding in a lot lately and it’s starting to affect my focus and sleep. I don’t need advice, just someone to sit with me while I say it out loud. I feel like I’m drowning in silence at home and in the office, and I’m terrified to ask for help. If you’ve ever felt this way, I’d be grateful to hear you’re not alone.
Re: Wellbeing initiative feedback One of our participants shared that they’ve been isolated for months and haven’t told anyone at work how much they’re struggling. They said they wish someone would notice they need a person, not a policy. Emotional support isn’t something you can automate—it’s about being seen and heard when you’re at your most vulnerable. This isn’t HR compliance—it’s human connection.
I don’t know who else to tell I’ve been pretending everything’s fine at work, but I’m breaking down after hours. I need emotional support that doesn’t come with a performance review attached. I don’t want to be labeled as “unstable” or “difficult.” I just want to feel like I matter, even if I’m not at my best right now.
Request for a quiet conversation I know you’re busy, and I don’t want to waste your time, but I’ve reached a point where I can’t keep pretending I’m okay. I need someone to talk to—not to fix it, just to listen. I’m afraid if I say it out loud, it’ll make it real. But I can’t keep carrying this alone. If you can spare 15 minutes this week, I’d mean the world to me.
Feeling overwhelmed lately I’ve been struggling to keep up with work since my mom’s health took a turn. There are days when I just need to vent to someone who gets it, but I don’t want to burden anyone. I know it’s not professional to say this in a work email, but I’m reaching out because I feel isolated and drained. If there’s any confidential support resource you can point me toward, I’d really appreciate it.
Checking in after your leave I noticed you’ve been quieter since you came back, and I want you to know it’s okay if things aren’t back to normal yet. No one expects you to be 100% after everything you’ve been through. Sometimes just having a safe space to talk without judgment can make a difference. I’m here if you want to grab coffee or need help adjusting your workload.
Re: Employee Wellbeing Survey Feedback Thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling — your honesty matters, and you’re not alone in this. Many employees report needing someone to listen without fear of judgment or professional consequences. Our EAP program offers free, private sessions with licensed counselors who specialize in emotional fatigue. You can access them anytime, anonymously if you prefer.
Need some space to breathe I’ve been carrying a lot emotionally these past few weeks, and it’s starting to affect my focus. I don’t have a formal crisis, but I’m tired of pretending everything’s fine when it’s not. I wish there was an easier way to say I just need to be heard — not fixed, not advised, just listened to. I know I shouldn’t have to ask for this, but I’m asking anyway.
Personal request — not urgent but important I’m writing because I’m at a point where I’m finding it harder to separate my personal struggles from my work. I don’t need solutions, just a little understanding. I’ve been dealing with loneliness that no one at the office knows about, and it’s wearing me down. If there’s any way to adjust my schedule temporarily so I can attend therapy during work hours, I’d be grateful.
Follow-up on wellbeing initiatives I understand you’re not comfortable sharing details, but I want you to know confidentiality is built into every conversation we have. Emotional exhaustion doesn’t always show up as burnout — sometimes it shows up as silence, or withdrawal, or just needing a person who won’t look away. Many of our clients say they only feel safe expressing this in writing. You’re not being weak for needing this.
Just wanted to check in while you’re abroad I know you’ve been working nonstop since you moved to Singapore and hardly ever call home. I can tell from your emails that you’re holding everything together, but I also know you’re not okay. You’ve always been the strong one, but even strong people need someone to cry to without guilt. Please don’t suffer in silence — I’m here, no matter the time zone.
I’m at my limit and don’t know who else to turn to I’ve been holding it together for weeks, but I’m not okay anymore. I need someone to talk to—not advice, not solutions, just someone who’ll listen without judging. I’ve missed deadlines because I can’t get out of bed some mornings, and I’m too ashamed to say why. If there’s any way to connect with someone through EAP or a quiet chat with HR, I’d be so grateful.
Following up on your recent message I noticed you mentioned feeling isolated and overwhelmed during our last check-in. I want you to know that emotional support is a legitimate part of workplace wellbeing. You don’t have to go through this alone—it’s okay to ask for help, even if it feels vulnerable. Our confidential counseling line is available 24/7, and I’m happy to walk you through it whenever you’re ready.
Let’s chat when you have a moment I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter lately, and I care about how you’re doing. If you’re feeling drained or just need a person to vent to, I’m here—not as your boss, but as someone who’s been there too. You don’t need to have it all figured out to talk. Sometimes just saying it out loud makes a difference.
Can we talk in private? I haven’t been myself lately and I’m finding it hard to cope with daily tasks. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m at a point where I need to talk to someone who understands. I’m not asking for time off—I’m asking for someone to hear me. I’ve never admitted this before, but I’m really hurting.
I’ve been thinking about you I know things haven’t been easy for you lately, and I don’t expect you to say it out loud, but I’m here if you want to cry, scream, or sit in silence. You don’t have to be strong all the time. I’ve been where you are, and I know how heavy it gets when no one knows.
Follow-up on wellness check As part of our holistic support initiative, I’d like to gently remind you that emotional resilience is as vital as productivity. Many employees hesitate to reach out, but seeking support isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s an act of courage. If you’re feeling isolated or emotionally drained, we have trained listeners available at no cost to you.
Apologies for my recent absence I owe you an explanation for my last few unexplained absences. It’s not illness—it’s emotional exhaustion I haven’t known how to name. I’ve been carrying a lot alone, and I realize now I can’t keep pretending I’m fine. I’m trying to get help, but I’m terrified of being seen as unreliable. Thank you for not giving up on me.
I’m struggling to cope right now I’ve been going through a really tough time lately and I don’t know who else to turn to. I need someone to talk to who won’t judge me or try to fix everything just yet. Just listening would mean more than you can imagine. I’m not asking for time off—just a kind ear when I’m ready to speak. It’s hard to admit this, but I feel so alone at work.
Following up on your recent conversation I want to thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling—it takes courage to speak up. Many of us carry emotional burdens in silence, and your honesty matters. Our Employee Assistance Program is available 24/7 for confidential support, whether you need a counselor or just someone to hear you out. You’re not expected to handle this alone. Please know your well-being is a priority here.
Let’s talk when you’re ready I noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn lately and I want you to know I’m here for you—not as your boss, but as a human being. If you need a quiet space to vent, or even just a walk around the block, I’ve got time. Emotional weight doesn’t disappear because the clock says it’s work hours. You don’t have to perform when you’re crumbling inside.
Can we grab coffee? I’ve been meaning to reach out but I’ve been too overwhelmed to put it into words. Lately, I just need someone who’ll sit with me in the quiet—not give advice, not solve it, just be present. It’s not about work, it’s about feeling like I’m not falling apart alone. If you’re free this week, I’d really appreciate it.
Support resources for your team Many of your staff are carrying invisible stress that doesn’t show up in KPIs. I’ve seen teams thrive when psychological safety is prioritized over productivity. Simple gestures—like asking “How are you *really* doing?”—can be lifesaving. Consider normalizing emotional check-ins as part of your culture, not just a one-off initiative.
I need to say something personal I’m writing this late at night because I’m afraid if I say it out loud, it won’t sound rational. I’ve been feeling hollow for months, like I’m just going through the motions. I don’t know if I need therapy or a friend or both. I’m not asking for help from you—just hoping you’ll understand why I’ve been distant.
Thought you’d want to know I know you’ve been working nonstop and haven’t told anyone how tired you are. I’ve seen the way you look in the mirror—like you’ve forgotten how to breathe. You don’t have to pretend you’re okay just because you’re the strong one. I’m here to listen, no questions, no solutions. Just you and me, and whatever you need to say.
Need to talk about how I’ve been feeling I’ve been struggling with anxiety lately and it’s affecting my focus at work. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I really need someone to listen without judgment. It’s not about fixing anything right now—just having a safe space to unpack what’s going on. I’m not asking for time off, just someone who understands.
Confidential support request from team member One of our direct reports reached out privately to say they’re feeling emotionally overwhelmed and need consistent emotional support. They’ve mentioned they don’t feel comfortable discussing it with colleagues and are seeking guidance on internal channels. While they’re not requesting accommodations yet, their tone suggests urgent psychological strain. We should ensure they’re connected with EAP resources immediately.
Following up on your note yesterday I noticed you mentioned needing a friend to talk to during our last check-in, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You don’t have to carry this alone, even if it feels too personal to share with the team. I’ve set up a private meeting with our counselor next week—no pressure to talk, just to show up. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Can we chat in private? Lately, I’ve been feeling hollow and isolated, even around people I trust. I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak, but I’m at a point where I need emotional backing, not advice. I’m not looking for a solution—I just need to be heard by someone who won’t minimize it. If there’s a quiet time this week, I’d appreciate it.
Private matter re: employee wellbeing I’ve been working closely with a member of your UK team who’s experiencing persistent emotional distress. They’ve indicated they feel unsafe expressing it within their current environment and need someone impartial to talk through it. They’re not seeking HR intervention per se, but rather consistent, non-clinical emotional presence. I recommend a discreet referral to your employee support line.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. You’ve mentioned before that you need someone to talk to when things get heavy, and I’m here, no matter how messy it is. It’s okay if you don’t have the words right now—I’ll just sit with you in it. You don’t have to pretend to be fine for my sake.
Not sure how to say this… I’ve been keeping a lot inside and it’s starting to weigh on me more than I let on. There are days when I just need to vent without someone trying to fix it or tell me to “snap out of it.” I think I need emotional support, not a pep talk. If there’s a confidential way to access someone from HR or a support line, I’d be grateful for the direction.
I’m struggling right now and need help I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately and don’t have anyone I feel comfortable talking to about what’s going on. I’m not asking for solutions, just someone to listen without judgment. I know this isn’t typical workplace chatter, but I’m at a point where I can’t keep carrying this alone.
Request for confidential support discussion I’m reaching out because I’ve been dealing with some personal challenges that are starting to affect my focus and energy at work. I don’t want to burden the team, but I need to talk to someone who can offer compassion, not just policy. I’ve never asked for this before, but I’m holding on by a thread.
Following up on your anonymous survey response Thank you for sharing how isolated you’ve been feeling lately — your honesty matters more than you know. Many employees hesitate to speak up, but you’re not alone in needing someone to lean on. Our EAP counselor is available for a private call anytime, no paperwork required.
Can we talk in private? I’ve been going through a rough patch and I’m finding it harder to show up the way I used to. I don’t have family nearby and my friends don’t understand what I’m dealing with. I’m not looking for advice — just someone who won’t look at me sideways when I say I’m not okay.
Need to talk about something personal I know this isn’t the kind of thing we usually discuss in a performance review, but I’ve hit a point where I can’t pretend everything’s fine. I need to talk to someone who won’t see this as a weakness. I’m not asking for time off — just for someone to hear me out.
Confidential request from a contractor As someone working remotely for your team, I’ve felt increasingly disconnected and unsupported emotionally. I don’t have a local network here, and I’m ashamed to say I haven’t told anyone how bad it’s gotten. I’d appreciate even a quiet referral to someone who understands what it’s like to feel this alone.
I’m worried about you I noticed you’ve been quiet lately, and I know you’ve always been the one who holds it all together. But I’ve seen how tired you look, and I think you’re carrying more than you should. You don’t have to fix everything on your own — I’m here if you just need to cry or scream or sit in silence.
Your wellbeing matters — no judgment here I’ve received your message through our internal wellbeing portal and wanted to respond personally. You’re not being dramatic — you’re human. Many of us have been where you are, and silence only makes it heavier. Please reach out to our counseling line tonight — it’s anonymous, available 24/7, and no one will know you called unless you want them to.
This might be a weird message… I’m writing this after midnight because I don’t know who else to say this to. I miss feeling like myself, and I don’t even remember when I last laughed without forcing it. Work feels like a cage sometimes, and I’m scared to admit how much I’m breaking inside. I just needed to write it down — even if no one reads it.
Feeling overwhelmed lately Lately I’ve been struggling to cope with everything on my plate. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I really need someone to listen without judgment. It’s not about fixing things right now—just having someone there to hear me out. I’ve been holding it together at work, but outside of hours, it’s been harder than I let on.
Confidential support request I’m reaching out because I’ve been dealing with a lot personally and I’m finding it hard to focus. I’m not asking for time off yet, but I’d appreciate guidance on internal resources for emotional wellbeing. Sometimes I just need to talk to someone who understands, not just offer advice. I’d prefer this stay between us.
Following up on your recent check-in I noticed you mentioned feeling isolated last week, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You don’t have to carry this alone—there are counselors available through our EAP, and I’m happy to help you connect. I’ve been there too, and having someone to talk to made all the difference. Please don’t hesitate to reach out again if you need to.
Can we talk sometime this week? I’ve been going through a rough patch and I’m finding it hard to keep up with my usual pace. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I really need a safe space to vent without being told to “just snap out of it.” I’ve never asked for this before, but I think I need to. I’d appreciate any time you can spare, even just fifteen minutes.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. I’m not here to fix anything—I just want you to know I’m around if you need to cry, scream, or sit in silence together. You don’t have to pretend everything’s fine with me. I’ve seen how hard you’ve been working, and it’s okay to not be okay.
Wellness check-in from external partner As part of the wellbeing initiative we’ve been supporting, I wanted to gently remind you that confidential emotional support services are still available to you. Many people find it helpful to speak with someone outside the organisation when workplace stress builds up. You’re not alone in this, and asking for help doesn’t weaken you—it shows strength.
Might need a quick chat I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal stuff and I’m starting to feel like I’m barely holding it together. I don’t want it to affect my work, but I also don’t want to isolate myself. Is there someone I could speak to confidentially? I don’t need solutions, just someone to hear me out without rushing me.
Can we talk sometime this week? I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I don’t know who else to turn to. I’m not asking for advice, just someone to listen without judgment. It’s been hard to focus at work and I think I need to unburden myself to someone who cares. I know this isn’t typical office chatter, but I trust you enough to be honest.
Follow-up on your recent request Thank you for sharing how isolated you’ve been feeling despite being surrounded by colleagues. Many employees go through this but hesitate to speak up, so I want you to know your vulnerability is valid. We have confidential peer support sessions available, and I can arrange a time for you to speak with a trained listener. You’re not expected to handle everything alone.
Checking in I noticed you’ve been quieter in team meetings lately and I want to make sure you’re okay. Sometimes work gets heavy and there’s no shame in needing a person to talk through things with. I’m not here to fix anything—just to be here if you want to vent, cry, or sit in silence. Your mental health matters more than any deadline.
Need to reach out Lately, I’ve been carrying so much inside that I don’t even know how to start explaining it. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’ve realized I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’m looking for someone who won’t rush me or offer solutions—just someone to sit with me in the mess. I’m scared to say this out loud, but I think I need comfort more than a fix.
Personal note from your wellbeing partner I’ve seen enough cases to know that silence doesn’t equal strength—it often means someone is holding their breath. If you need a safe space to say what you can’t say at home or in the office, I’m here. No agenda, no notes, no follow-up unless you ask. Just you, me, and whatever needs to come out.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but your voice over the phone lately sounds hollow. I’m not asking you to fix anything—I just need you to know I’m here to listen, even if it’s three a.m. and you’re crying. You don’t have to be strong for me. Let me be your quiet place.
Can I ask for a coffee chat? I’ve been trying to manage things on my own, but I’m starting to crack under the weight of everything. I don’t need a solution—just someone to hear me say it out loud without interruption. You’ve always had this calm way of listening, and I’d be grateful if you’d let me talk. I promise it won’t take more than twenty minutes.
I’m struggling to keep up I’ve been feeling really drained lately and I don’t think I can keep pretending everything’s fine. I need someone to just listen, not fix things or tell me what to do. I’m not asking for solutions—just a little space to be heard without judgment. It’s been hard to talk about this at work, but I trust you enough to say it now.
Need to talk privately I’ve noticed you’ve seemed distant the past few weeks and I want you to know it’s safe to talk to me, no matter what’s going on. I’m not here to solve it—I’m here to hold space for you. If you need to vent, cry, or just sit in silence, I’m available. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Confidential support resources I understand you’ve been going through a tough time and I want to remind you that our Employee Assistance Program is there for listening, not advising. You don’t have to explain everything or have it all figured out—just showing up is enough. Many people use this service simply to feel less alone during hard moments.
Can I ask you something personal? I’ve been sitting on this for days and I’m scared to say it out loud, but I think I need to. I don’t want advice or a to-do list—I just need to say it to someone who won’t minimize it. I’m tired of smiling through the pain and faking it. Can we grab coffee tomorrow? I won’t even need you to respond—just be there.
Request for a quiet chat I know it’s not policy to bring personal stuff to work, but I’m at a point where I can’t separate it anymore. I’m not looking for fixes—I just need to feel like I’m not the only one who’s broken sometimes. If you’ve ever felt this way, I’d appreciate just hearing that I’m not alone.
I need to tell you something I’ve been carrying this alone for months and I don’t know how else to say it without sounding weak. I’m not asking you to fix me—I just need you to sit with me while I say it out loud. I’ve been crying myself to sleep and I don’t want to pretend I’m okay anymore. I trust you not to turn this into a problem to solve.
Follow-up on our conversation I’ve been reflecting on what you shared last week and I want to honor the vulnerability you showed. This isn’t about productivity or performance—it’s about being human when you’re barely holding on. You don’t owe anyone a polished version of yourself right now. Just breathe. I’m still here if you need to say it again.
Can we talk later? I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I don’t know who else to reach out to. I need emotional support, even if it’s just a quick chat during lunch. It’s not about solving anything—just having someone listen without judgment. I know it’s unusual to ask this at work, but I’m at a point where I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine.
Follow-up on your recent request I wanted to personally thank you for being honest about how you’ve been feeling. Many people hesitate to say they need a friend to talk to, but your courage matters. Our Employee Assistance Program can connect you with a licensed counselor today if you’re open to it. You’re not alone in this, and your well-being is a priority here.
Quick check-in I noticed you’ve seemed quieter than usual this week and I wanted to check in. If you need someone to talk to—even outside of work hours—I’m here. It’s okay to not be okay, and I’ve been in your shoes before. No need to explain anything if you’re not ready, but I hope you know I care.
Just needed to say this Lately I’ve been carrying a lot alone and I don’t think I can keep doing it. I don’t need advice, just a listening ear—someone who won’t try to fix me. I’ve been too embarrassed to say this out loud, but I’m hoping you might understand. If you have five minutes anytime this week, I’d really appreciate it.
Re: Your feedback on workplace culture After our conversation last month, I’ve reflected on how isolated many of us feel even in open environments. What I truly crave isn’t a solution—it’s connection, a safe space to voice what’s heavy inside. Even a brief, private word with someone trustworthy could make all the difference. I’m not asking for a formal program—just the possibility of being heard.
Something I’ve been meaning to share I’ve been struggling privately with anxiety and burnout, and I’m finding it harder to hide. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m reaching out because I need a person, not a policy. I’m not asking for time off—I’m asking for a moment of humanity. If you’re ever available for a coffee or a walk, I’d be grateful.
I’m not okay I’ve been putting on a front at work for months, laughing when I want to cry, nodding when I’m crumbling inside. I’m not asking you to fix me—I just need you to sit with me in this. Even if we don’t say much, being near someone who gets it is the only thing keeping me grounded. I know you’re busy, but I’m really hurting.
Need some time off for personal reasons I’ve been struggling lately with anxiety and depression, and it’s starting to affect my ability to focus at work. I’m not at my best, and I think I need a short break to see a therapist and reset. I know this isn’t ideal timing, but I’m hoping you can understand this isn’t something I can just push through. I’ll make sure my tasks are covered before I step away, and I’m happy to provide a doctor’s note if needed.
Follow-up on your recent wellness request Thank you for sharing how overwhelmed you’ve been feeling since the merger. Many employees are experiencing similar stress, and your honesty is appreciated. We’ve arranged a confidential session with our EAP counselor for next week, and I’ve flagged your workload for temporary adjustment. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more time or resources — your well-being matters here.
Check-in on your recent absence I noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings and missed the team lunch last week, and I wanted to check in personally. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know I’ve noticed things haven’t been easy for you lately. If you need to adjust your hours or take a few days to recharge, I’m fully supportive. Your health comes before any deadline.
Can we talk about my work schedule? Lately, I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional pressure that’s making it hard to keep up with my usual pace. It’s not about laziness — I just need a little flexibility to manage appointments and quiet time. I’ve been seeing a counselor and it’s helping, but I still need some breathing room at work. I’m committed to my responsibilities, but I can’t do it at full throttle right now.
I need to be honest about how I’m doing I’ve been holding it together at work, but at home, I’m falling apart. The insomnia, the crying fits, the constant dread — it’s not something I can fake anymore. I don’t know how to say this without sounding weak, but I need to take a step back before I break completely. I’m scared to ask for help, but I’m even more scared of losing myself entirely.
Observations on team morale and individual wellbeing During our recent on-site review, I noticed several team members exhibiting signs of emotional exhaustion — withdrawn behavior, delayed responses, and uncharacteristic errors. One employee mentioned privately that they’re navigating chronic grief and burnout with no institutional support. While this isn’t my direct responsibility, I urge you to act before turnover spikes. Compassionate leadership here isn’t optional — it’s operational.
Re: invoice #INV-2024-0872 & personal update I wanted to let you know I won’t be able to meet the deadline on this project. I’ve been dealing with severe emotional distress since my mother’s passing, and processing it while working has been overwhelming. I’m in therapy now and getting better slowly, but I need a little more time. I appreciate your patience — I didn’t want to just disappear without explaining.
Need some time off – family matters I’ve been dealing with a lot personally since my mother passed away last month. It’s been hard to focus at work, and I’m struggling to keep up with my usual pace. I’m not asking for much, just a few days to breathe and sort things out. I know the team is stretched thin, but I hope you understand this isn’t something I’m taking lightly.
Follow-up on leave request – emotional wellbeing We’ve noted your recent request for compassionate leave and want to assure you that your wellbeing is our priority. Many employees face similar challenges after the loss of a close family member, and we’re here to support you through this. Please consider our counseling services or an extension if you need more time. You’re not alone in this, and there’s no pressure to return before you’re ready.
Checking in – things okay? I’ve noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past couple of weeks, and I wanted to reach out quietly. I don’t need details if you’re not ready to share, but I want you to know I see you and I care. Life doesn’t pause for deadlines, and your mental space matters more than any report right now. If you want to talk, my door is open.
Just wanted to say I’m here I know things have been incredibly heavy for you since everything happened, and I wish I could take some of the weight away. You don’t have to pretend to be okay around me — I’ve been where you are, and it’s okay to fall apart. I’m not going anywhere, even if you just need silence or a cup of tea.
Request for remote work adjustment My grief has made commuting and office presence more taxing than I anticipated. I’m not ready to be around people yet, but I’m still committed to delivering my work on time. Working from home has allowed me to manage my energy better and get through the day without collapsing. I’d appreciate continued flexibility until things settle.
Supporting team wellness after bereavement In our recent wellness audit, loss-related stress emerged as a recurring theme across departments. Employees are quietly carrying grief while trying to maintain performance, often with no formal support. Human resources should consider proactive check-ins, not just reactive leave policies. A little compassion goes further than a policy manual.
Can you call me? I miss you I’ve been thinking about you nonstop since the funeral. I know you’re putting on a brave face at work, but I can hear it in your voice — you’re exhausted and broken inside. You don’t have to hold it together for anyone, least of all me. I wish you’d let me come over, even if we just sit in silence. I’m not leaving till you let me in.
Need some time off – personal situation I’m dealing with a really tough stretch personally after being let go last week. It’s been hard to keep up with daily routines, and I’m struggling to find my footing. I’m not asking for much, just a few days to regroup and handle some family matters. I’ll make sure my tasks are covered before I go and will check in remotely if needed.
Follow-up on your recent request I heard you’ve been going through a rough time since your position was eliminated, and I want you to know I see how much this has affected you. You’ve always been reliable, and I understand this isn’t just about work—it’s about stability and dignity. Please take the time you need to recover, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want help connecting with EAP resources.
Support resources available during transition We’re aware that recent changes may have left you feeling overwhelmed and emotionally drained. Your well-being matters to us, and we’re here to support you through this difficult period. Whether you need counseling, financial guidance, or just someone to talk to, our employee assistance program is open 24/7. You’re not alone in this.
Just checking in I know things have been rough since you lost your gig last month. I’ve been there—I spent three months doubting myself after mine, and it felt like the world had paused. If you want to grab coffee or just vent, I’m here. No judgment, no pressure. You’re still the same sharp, kind person you’ve always been.
Request for flexibility while I sort things out I’ve had some unexpected personal challenges since my contract wasn’t renewed, and I’m trying to manage bills, housing, and my mental health all at once. I’m still committed to my duties and can deliver on deadlines, but I might need to adjust my hours for a few weeks. I’m not asking for special treatment—just understanding while I rebuild.
Can you help me explain this to HR? My son’s been crushed since he lost his job two weeks ago. He barely eats, won’t answer his phone, and says he’s a failure. I know you’re not his boss, but I’m scared he’s going to shut down completely. Could you maybe reach out gently and let him know his work mattered? He needs to hear it from someone outside the family.
Offering confidential support during career transition Many professionals I’ve worked with experience profound isolation after sudden job loss—not just financially, but emotionally. I’ve seen people spiral because they feel ashamed to speak up. If you’re carrying that weight, please know it’s not weakness to need help. I offer free 30-minute sessions for those navigating this kind of transition. You deserve support.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal challenges lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little space to get my head straight. I’ve got a few things to sort out at home and I’d really appreciate it if I could take a couple of days next week without being pinged for non-urgent tasks.
Following up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned you’ve been going through a tough patch recently and I want you to know I see you. Your work hasn’t slipped, but I know that doesn’t mean you’re fine. Please use the EAP resources if you haven’t already — they’re confidential and there’s no stigma attached. We’re here to support you, not judge you.
Confidential support options available As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, I wanted to remind you that our counseling services are available 24/7 and completely private. Many team members have used them during periods of high personal stress, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. You don’t need to explain anything to HR — just call the number on the portal.
Can we talk? Things outside of work have gotten really overwhelming and I’m struggling to keep up with my usual pace. I’m not sure how to ask for help without sounding weak, but I need to say it out loud. I’ve been up most nights trying to fix things that won’t fix themselves. I’m not asking for leave yet, but I’m not sure how much longer I can fake being okay.
You okay? I saw you sitting alone at lunch again and I just wanted to check in. I’ve been there too — when everything feels like it’s falling apart and you don’t know who to turn to. I didn’t say anything last time, but I’m saying it now: you don’t have to carry this alone. I’ve got your back.
I need to talk about work I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. You haven’t answered my calls in days and I’ve noticed you crying after Zoom calls. I’m not trying to overstep, but if your job is making you feel this broken, maybe you need to step back. Your health matters more than any paycheck.
Re: Wellbeing assessment – private note During our confidential intake, you mentioned recent difficulties with sleep, isolation, and recurring anxiety that began after your mother’s hospitalization. These are common markers of personal distress that can impact workplace performance. I strongly encourage you to schedule a session with our trauma-informed counselor — no manager will see this unless you choose to share.
Need some time off soon I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because things at home have gotten really overwhelming. I’m not sleeping well and I feel like I’m carrying the weight of everything alone. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I need a few days to reset and get some support sorted out.
Following up on your recent conversation I wanted to check in after our talk last week—you mentioned you’re dealing with some heavy personal stuff outside of work. I want you to know the team has your back and deadlines can be adjusted if needed. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need space or resources.
Confidential support options available We’ve noticed a recent dip in your engagement metrics and wanted to gently remind you that our Employee Assistance Program offers free, confidential counseling. Many employees find it helpful during times of emotional strain or when life feels unmanageable. You’re not expected to handle this alone.
Just wanted to say I’m here I’ve noticed you’ve been quiet lately and I get the sense you’re going through something tough. I’ve been there before—when everything feels like it’s collapsing and no one else seems to notice. You don’t have to explain anything, but I’m here if you want to talk or just sit in silence together.
Request for flexibility next week I’m currently dealing with a family crisis that’s consuming most of my emotional energy, and I’m finding it hard to focus during core hours. I’ve attached a revised schedule that allows me to work remotely in the mornings and return to the office for critical meetings. I promise I won’t drop any deliverables, but I need this adjustment to stay afloat.
Re: Wellbeing Check-In During our recent review, you mentioned feeling emotionally drained and disconnected from your usual support network. I want to emphasize that this is not a performance issue—it’s a human issue, and it’s valid. I’ve included links to trauma-informed resources and local support groups that specialize in isolation-related stress.
I’m worried about you You haven’t answered any of my calls for over a week, and I can tell something’s wrong. I know you’ve always hated asking for help, but this isn’t just about work anymore—you’re shutting down, and I’m scared for you. Please let me help, even if it’s just listening. You don’t have to pretend you’re fine.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal issues lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. A close friend of mine is going through a rough patch and has been struggling to cope. I’ve been trying to support them, but it’s taken a toll on my own mental space and I need a few days to regroup and be there for them properly.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I understand you’ve been supporting a loved one who’s been facing significant emotional challenges recently. Your honesty about the situation is appreciated, and we want to ensure you have the resources you need during this time. Please let us know if you’d like to connect with our EAP counselor or if additional leave accommodations would help. Your well-being matters here.
Checking in – I noticed you’ve seemed off I’ve observed you’ve been quieter than usual over the past couple of weeks and I wanted to reach out gently. If you’re carrying a heavy load personally, please know it’s okay to talk about it. I’m not asking for details, just want to make sure you’re not trying to handle everything alone. We can adjust workload if needed.
Request for flexible hours Things at home have been incredibly draining lately — someone I care about is battling deep emotional distress and needs constant support. I’m trying to balance work with being present for them during their lowest moments. I’d be grateful if I could shift my hours to mornings so I can be there for therapy appointments and evening check-ins.
Can I talk? I’m reaching out because I’m at my limit and I don’t know who else to turn to. Someone I’m close to hasn’t slept in days and keeps saying they’re not worth helping. I’ve tried everything — calling crisis lines, researching therapists — but I feel helpless. I just need someone to listen without judgment, even if it’s just for ten minutes.
Supporting teams through personal hardship In my work with global teams, I’ve seen how unspoken personal crises — like watching a loved one spiral into depression — quietly erode productivity and morale. Many employees won’t speak up unless they feel safe, so I encourage managers to normalize conversations about emotional well-being. Small gestures, like offering time off without scrutiny, can prevent burnout before it becomes crisis.
Request for confidentiality on personal matter I’m writing this in confidence because I don’t want it circulating. My partner is in the middle of a severe mental health episode and I’m their primary caregiver now. I’m exhausted but still showing up for work — I just need a little flexibility and understanding, not pity or gossip. No one else here needs to know, and I’d appreciate it if you kept this between us.
Need a few days off I’m going through a rough time and can’t sleep at night. It’s affecting my focus at work, and I’m worried I’m making mistakes I normally wouldn’t. I don’t want to let the team down, but I need to step back for a bit to get some medical help and just breathe again.
Request for flexible hours I’ve been battling constant anxiety lately and it’s left me completely drained, both mentally and physically. I’ve tried pushing through, but I keep waking up at 3 a.m. with my heart racing and my mind spinning. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little space to stabilize before I can show up as my full self again.
Follow-up on recent performance I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter than usual over the past few weeks, and your output has dipped noticeably. I’m not here to reprimand you — I want to know if something’s going on privately that I can help with. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline, and I’m here to listen if you need to talk.
Confidential support resources We’ve received an anonymous report indicating you may be experiencing severe emotional distress and sleep deprivation. This is not meant to invade your privacy, but to offer support. Our Employee Assistance Program provides free, confidential counseling sessions seven days a week. You don’t have to carry this alone.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. You haven’t answered my texts, and I remember you saying last month you were barely sleeping. If you need someone to sit with you while you cry or just sit in silence, I’m here. No judgment, no pressure, just presence.
Re: Wellbeing check-in During our last session, you mentioned feeling constantly on edge and unable to rest even when you’re exhausted. That kind of chronic stress doesn’t resolve on its own — it compounds. I recommend you speak with your HR department about extended leave or temporary reassignment. Your health is not a luxury; it’s the foundation.
Need to talk privately I’ve been holding it together for months, but lately I’ve been falling apart at work. I cry in the bathroom stall, wake up drenched in sweat, and it’s getting harder to pretend I’m fine. I don’t know how to ask for help without being seen as weak, but I can’t keep doing this. Can we talk, just once, without anyone else knowing?
Need some time off – personal stuff Things have been really tough since the split. I’m struggling to keep up with my usual pace and need a few days to get my head straight. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I’m not at my best right now and I don’t want to let the team down by being distracted. I’ll make sure everything is covered before I step away.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I understand you’ve been dealing with a lot personally since your separation, and I want to acknowledge how challenging this must be. Our EAP program has counselors available if you’d like to talk through this, no questions asked. Please let me know if you need additional flexibility or extended leave options—we’re here to support you.
Check-in on your wellbeing I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter lately and wanted to check in. Life hasn’t been easy since your breakup, and I just want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. Your work hasn’t slipped, but if you need to adjust deadlines or work remotely for a bit, say the word. We care about you beyond your output.
Can we chat? It’s been months since I lost my partner, and I still feel like I’m walking through fog most days. I’m trying to keep up, but some mornings I just can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to seem weak, but I’m not sure how else to ask for space without sounding like I’m giving up.
Just checking in I know you’ve been hitting rough patches since everything fell apart, and I haven’t said much, but I’ve been thinking of you. You don’t have to put on a brave face with me—I remember how hard things were for you last year. If you want to vent, cry, or just sit in silence over tea, I’m here.
Re: Your emotional wellbeing survey response Your anonymous feedback mentioned ongoing distress following a major life event. While I can’t access personal details, I urge you to reach out to your internal support resources. Many employees in similar situations find relief through structured counseling or peer groups. Your resilience is noted, but you don’t have to carry this alone.
Request for confidential discussion I’ve been overwhelmed since my marriage ended, and it’s starting to affect my focus during team calls. I’m not asking for special treatment—just a little understanding while I rebuild. I know this isn’t typical workplace stuff, but it’s real, and I’m trying to manage it without falling apart. Please don’t mention this to anyone.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been dealing with some really tough days lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not sure how long this will last, but I need a few days to get my head straight. I know it’s inconvenient, but I’m reaching out because I trust you’ll understand this isn’t something I’d bring up lightly.
Check-in on your well-being I’ve noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past couple of weeks, and I want you to know I’m here if you need to talk. Work can wait when personal struggles take priority. Please don’t feel like you have to carry this alone — even if it’s just over coffee or a walk.
Confidential support resources available If you’re facing emotional or personal challenges that are impacting your ability to engage fully at work, we have confidential counseling services available through our EAP. Many employees find it helpful to speak with a professional before things escalate. You don’t need to explain anything — just reach out and we’ll handle the rest with discretion.
You okay? I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I just wanted to say I’ve noticed. Life’s been heavy for you these past weeks, and I get that it’s hard to talk about. You don’t owe anyone the details, but I’m here if you want to vent, cry, or just sit in silence together.
Request to adjust deadlines – personal reasons I’m going through a very draining period personally and need a bit more breathing room on the Q3 reports. I’m still committed to delivering quality work, but I need to stretch the timeline by a week if possible. I’ve attached a revised plan and hope you’ll consider this respectfully. I’m not asking for special treatment — just a little understanding.
Hope you’re holding up I heard from your sister you’ve been struggling with what’s been going on at home. I don’t know all the details and I won’t push, but I want you to know I’m not going anywhere. You’ve always been the strong one, but now it’s okay to let someone else hold you up.
Follow-up on your wellbeing survey Your anonymous response indicated you’re experiencing significant emotional strain, and I wanted to personally follow up. Our data suggests employees in your situation benefit most from early intervention, even if it’s just a single session. You’re not alone, and you’re not a burden for needing support — we’re here to help, not judge.
Need some time off — personal stuff I'm going through a rough time with anxiety and depression, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’ve been seeing a therapist regularly, but I need a few days to reset without the pressure of deadlines. I know this isn’t ideal, but I’m committed to catching up as soon as I’m back.
Request for flexible schedule next week Lately I’ve been battling overwhelming stress and low mood that’s making it hard to show up the way I want to. I’m not asking for leave, just the freedom to start later and log off earlier for a few days while I rebuild my routine. I’ve been managing this privately but now I need to be honest so I can keep performing.
Following up on your recent check-in I noticed you mentioned having a hard time emotionally last week, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You don’t have to explain details, but I’m here to help you access our EAP or adjust your workload if needed. Your well-being matters more than any project timeline right now.
Wellness resources available — confidential support Many of our team members are navigating personal challenges that impact their daily work, and our confidential counseling service is there to help without judgment. Whether you’re feeling drained, isolated, or just not yourself, you’re not alone. You can book a session anytime through the portal — nothing goes on your file.
Apologies for last week’s output I’ve been struggling with mental health issues that I haven’t shared until now — it’s been a long, dark stretch, and I’ve been trying to power through on my own. I realize my work quality dropped, and I owe you an apology. I’m in therapy, on medication, and I’m slowly getting back on track.
Re: Your feedback on workplace culture Several staff members have quietly mentioned feeling emotionally unsupported during periods of acute personal distress, particularly when they’re dealing with grief, chronic illness, or undiagnosed mental health conditions. This isn’t just about absences — it’s about silent suffering that erodes trust and productivity. A proactive, stigma-free policy could make a real difference.
Need some time off – family situation I’m reaching out to ask for a few days off as my family is dealing with something really heavy right now. After the car crash last week, everyone’s been emotionally drained and struggling to get through each day. We’re not talking much, eating poorly, and just trying to keep it together. I need to be there for my siblings and parents, and I hope you understand how urgent this is.
Request for leave due to personal crisis I’ve been meaning to speak with you privately about a personal matter affecting my household. My wife and I lost our son in a traffic incident last month, and the grief has overwhelmed us both. We’re navigating therapy, funeral arrangements, and the collapse of our daily routine. I’ve attached my leave request for the next three weeks and would appreciate your support as we try to rebuild some sense of stability.
Follow-up on your emotional leave request Thank you for sharing the details of your family’s situation following the accident. We recognize how deeply this has impacted your ability to focus at work. Our EAP provider is available for confidential counseling, and we’ve extended your bereavement leave by an additional week. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need help coordinating childcare, medical records, or any logistical support during this time.
Can we talk? Personal stuff I’m not sure how to say this without sounding like I’m making a big deal, but things at home have fallen apart since the crash. My mom’s in hospital, my dad’s barely sleeping, and I’m the only one left holding things together. I’ve been coming in late and zoning out in meetings because I’m just running on fumes. I’m not asking for sympathy, just a little grace until I can get my head above water.
Can you help? It’s been a nightmare I know you’re not family, but you’ve always been kind to us, and I don’t know who else to turn to. Since the accident, my brother hasn’t left his room for three days. He won’t answer calls, won’t eat, and keeps whispering that it’s his fault. We’re terrified he’s going to do something to himself. I’ve been crying every night and I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending I’m okay.
Support for employee in crisis I’ve been working behind the scenes with your team to assess the emotional toll on staff following the recent tragedy. The survivor’s guilt and collective grief are palpable — even those not directly related are withdrawing or having panic attacks at their desks. I recommend a temporary pause on performance reviews and the implementation of peer support circles. This isn’t just about time off — it’s about psychological safety.
I’m not sure I can come back next week I’ve tried to push through, but every time I sit at my desk, I hear the screech of tires in my head. My brother didn’t make it, and my parents are too shattered to talk about it. I’ve been sleeping on the couch at their house, skipping meals, and forgetting to shower. I don’t know how to explain this to anyone — I don’t even know how to explain it to myself. I need more time. I’m not sure I’m ready.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal issues lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not ready to go into details but I need a few days to get my head straight. I appreciate your understanding and will make sure everything is covered before I leave.
Following up on your request I noticed you mentioned things have been overwhelming lately and I want you to know I see you. You don’t owe me any specifics but please know the team has your back. Let’s schedule a quiet chat next week so we can figure out what support looks like for you.
Support resources available to you We’re aware that many of our employees are navigating challenging personal circumstances right now. Whether it’s grief, anxiety, or just needing space to breathe, our EAP is active and confidential. You’re not alone in this and there’s no shame in reaching out for help.
Can we talk about a short break? Lately I’ve been struggling to keep up with daily demands because of things happening outside of work. It’s not depression or anything clinical, but I’m emotionally drained and need a pause. I’ve got a backlog of tasks I can wrap up before stepping away.
Hey – just checking in I heard you’ve been going through a rough patch and I wanted to say I’m here if you want to vent. No pressure to talk, but coffee or a walk after work sometimes helps more than you’d think. You’ve always been there for others – now it’s your turn.
Request for flexible hours next week I’ve had some family complications that are taking up most of my mental energy and I need to adjust my schedule to handle them properly. I’m not asking for time off, just a shift in hours so I can manage things in the morning. I’ll still deliver everything on time.
I’m sorry I’ve been quiet I’ve been wrapped up in my own mess and haven’t been good about reaching out. It’s not that I don’t care – I’m just too tired to pretend I’m okay. I’m working on it, slowly, and I hope you’ll still be around when I’m ready to talk again.
Need some time off — personal reasons I'm going through a rough time and I need to take a few days off to sort things out personally. Your understanding means a lot right now. I’ve attached a doctor’s note for the record and will be available by email for urgent matters. I know this isn’t ideal but I’m not in a place to push through work right now. I’ll be back next week with a clearer head.
Request for flexible hours — personal situation I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m in a difficult period that I’m trying to manage quietly, and I’d really appreciate some flexibility in my schedule. I’m not looking for leave, just adjusted hours for a few weeks while things stabilize. Your support during this time would mean the world to me. I promise to keep my output steady, even if my hours shift.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’ve been going through a hard time lately and wanted to check in privately to see how you’re coping. Our EAP program offers confidential counselling sessions, and I can send you the access code immediately if you’d like. You don’t need to explain anything — we’re here to help, not judge. Let me know if you’d prefer a call or just an email exchange for now.
Quick check-in — I noticed you’ve been quiet I’ve noticed you haven’t been as active in team chats lately, and I’m not sure if it’s workload or something else. If you’re struggling with anything personal, I want you to know it’s okay to talk to me. You don’t have to share details, but I care about your wellbeing beyond just KPIs. Let me know if you’d like to step back on some tasks for a bit — I’ve got your back.
Kind of a bad week — need your advice Things have been overwhelming lately and I’m having a hard time keeping up with deadlines. It’s not just work stress — personal stuff has piled up and I’m running on empty. I know I shouldn’t let it spill into the office but I’m afraid I’m not hiding it well. Would it be possible to talk about lightening my load for a couple of weeks? I’d be grateful for any space you can give me.
Confidential: Employee wellbeing follow-up I’m reaching out on behalf of the employee assistance program. We understand you’ve been navigating a prolonged period of emotional strain and wanted to offer support before it impacts your performance. You’re not alone in this, and our services are completely anonymous. If you’re ready to speak with someone, I can connect you within 24 hours. This message is for your eyes only — no one else has access to this thread.
Real talk — I think you’re drowning I’ve been meaning to say this because I’ve noticed you haven’t laughed once in weeks and you keep cancelling lunch. I’m not asking for the full story, but I know what burnout looks like and you’re living it. If you need to vent, I’m here. If you need to take a mental health day, I’ll cover your calls. You’re not weak for needing help — you’re human. And I’ve got you.
Need some time off – personal stuff I’ve been going through a rough time lately and it’s starting to affect my work. I’m not sleeping well and I’m finding it hard to focus during meetings. I’d appreciate if we could talk about some temporary adjustments to my workload. I’m not asking for a long break, just a few days to reset and get back on track.
Following up on your recent note I heard you’ve been dealing with some heavy personal challenges, and I want you to know I see you. Your performance hasn’t slipped, but I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter than usual. If you need space or flexibility, please say so — we value you beyond your output. You’re not alone in this.
Confidential: Support resources for you I understand you’ve been facing a particularly hard stretch in your personal life and that it’s weighing on you emotionally. You’re not expected to compartmentalize everything at work. Our EAP program offers free counseling sessions, and I’ve attached the access details. No one needs to know you reached out — this is entirely private.
Just checking in I know things haven’t been easy for you lately, and I just wanted to say I’m here if you want to vent or even just sit in silence. I’ve been there too — that feeling like everything’s falling apart but you have to keep smiling at your desk. You don’t have to pretend with me.
Request for adjusted hours I’ve been struggling to manage my energy levels due to some ongoing family matters. It’s not something I want to discuss in detail, but I need to shift my start time to 10am for the next few weeks. I’ll cover all my deliverables and make sure I’m available for core meetings. Thank you for understanding.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been pushing through without saying much, but I can hear it in your voice. You’ve been up all night and barely eating. You don’t have to be strong all the time — I’m your sister, not your boss. If you need to step back from work for a bit, I’ll help with everything here.
Re: Employee wellbeing follow-up During my assessment, a number of staff reported feeling emotionally drained due to extended personal stressors that spilled into their work. This isn’t just about productivity — it’s about human resilience. I recommend proactive check-ins and destigmatizing mental health conversations. People need to know it’s safe to ask for help.
Need some time off — personal stuff I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately and it’s not because I’m lazy. I’m going through a rough time personally and I need a few days to reset. I’m not asking for leave because I’m overwhelmed with tasks — I’m asking because I’m emotionally drained and need space to breathe. I’ll make sure everything is covered before I go, but I need this for my well-being.
Follow-up on your recent request for support Thank you for reaching out about what you’re facing. I understand you’re dealing with a difficult period and that you’re not comfortable sharing details. Our EAP provider is available 24/7 for confidential counselling, and I’ve attached their contact information. You’re not expected to perform at full capacity right now — your health comes first. Please let us know how we can help you transition back smoothly when you’re ready.
Can we talk? I’m not okay I know this isn’t typical workplace talk, but I’m at a point where I can’t fake being fine anymore. There’s a lot I’m carrying that I haven’t told anyone — grief, anxiety, sleepless nights. I don’t need a solution, just someone who won’t judge me for being broken. If there’s any flexibility in my schedule or remote options, I’d be grateful. I’m trying to hold it together, but I’m hanging by a thread.
Re: Your performance review I noticed your output has dipped over the past six weeks, and while I’m not asking for an explanation, I want you to know I see you. Life doesn’t pause for work deadlines, and if you’re dealing with something personal, I want to support you — not penalise you. We can adjust your KPIs temporarily, or pair you with a mentor. Your value here isn’t measured in spreadsheets or hours logged. You matter more than your output.
I heard you’ve been under a lot of stress I don’t know if you remember, but we used to talk every Sunday. I’ve noticed you’ve been quiet lately, and I’m worried. I’m not here to fix anything — just to sit with you, even if it’s over a phone call. You’ve always been the one who listened to me — now it’s my turn. You don’t have to be strong right now. Just be.
Confidential wellbeing check-in As your external wellbeing advisor, I’m reaching out not because you’ve flagged anything, but because patterns suggest you’re in a high-stress phase. Many employees in your role face burnout quietly — isolation, irritability, withdrawal. You’re not failing — you’re enduring. The sessions I offer are completely private, and we can schedule them after hours if you’re concerned about visibility. Your silence doesn’t mean you’re fine.
Emergency leave request — family emergency I need to take urgent leave starting tomorrow. It’s not a medical issue, but something deeply personal that requires my full attention. I can’t talk about it yet — I’m still processing it myself. I’ve coordinated with Sarah to cover my client calls, and I’ll be reachable briefly for critical matters, but I won’t be responding to emails. I’m sorry for the short notice, but I need this time to recover — emotionally, not just physically.
I need some time off – things are overwhelming I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because I’m dealing with some deep emotional issues outside of office hours. I don’t know how to explain it without sounding dramatic, but I feel like I’m falling apart inside. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a few days to breathe and reset before I come back fully present.
Follow-up on your recent request for support Thank you for sharing how much emotional turmoil you’ve been experiencing these past weeks. Your honesty is appreciated, and we want to ensure you’re connected with our confidential counseling services. Please let me know a convenient time to discuss workplace accommodations or flexible scheduling without pressure. You’re not alone in this.
Need to talk – it’s personal I’ve been holding it together at work, but the truth is I’m at a breaking point. Sleepless nights and constant anxiety have made it hard to focus, and I’m scared I’ll make a mistake that affects the team. I don’t want to quit, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. Can we talk privately this week?
Checking in – I noticed you’ve seemed off I’ve observed that you’ve been withdrawn over the last few weeks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. If something personal is weighing on you, please know I’m here to listen, not to judge. We can adjust deadlines or workload temporarily if it helps you get back on your feet. Your well-being matters more than any report.
Re: Employee wellness initiative – confidential feedback I’ve worked with several teams under stress, and the most common unspoken issue is emotional exhaustion masked as low productivity. One employee confided they’re coping with grief and isolation, yet fear stigma if they speak up. I urge you to create safe channels for these conversations before burnout becomes irreversible.
Can I work remotely for a bit? I’m going through a really tough time right now and the daily commute is adding to my stress. Being in the office feels overwhelming, and I need space to manage my mental health without judgment. I’m still fully committed to my tasks and can be available during core hours. This isn’t laziness – it’s survival.
I’m worried about [Employee Name] I’ve noticed my sibling hasn’t been themselves lately – they cancel plans, cry for no reason, and skip meals. They told me work is making them feel worthless, and they’re scared to ask for help. I know you’re not their therapist, but maybe there’s a way you could gently check in? They don’t know how to reach out.
Need some time off to sort things out I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because I’m dealing with some intense personal issues. The weight of everything has been crushing me, and I don’t think I can function at full capacity until I get some space. I’m not asking for a long break, just a few days to breathe and see a counselor. I promise I’ll be back focused and ready to contribute.
Following up on your recent request I understand you’ve been going through a difficult time emotionally and I want to assure you that your well-being matters here. You don’t have to explain every detail, but if there’s anything I can do to support you — adjusted deadlines, remote work, or access to EAP — please let me know. Your performance hasn’t slipped because of effort, and I want to make sure you’re not carrying this alone.
Confidential support resources available We’ve noticed a change in your recent engagement and want to offer our confidential emotional support services without judgment. Many employees face periods of deep emotional strain, and you’re not alone in this. Our on-site counselor is available this week, and all conversations are private. You don’t need to justify your need — only accept the help.
Can we talk? I’m not okay Lately I’ve felt like I’m falling apart inside, and I can’t pretend anymore. I’m not sleeping, I’m crying at my desk, and I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak. I know this isn’t typical workplace talk, but I trust you enough to be honest. I just need someone to listen, even if there’s no solution yet.
You’ve been quiet lately… I’ve noticed you haven’t joined lunch or Slack chats the past week and I’m worried. You always had this light in you, and now it feels like you’re carrying something heavy. I don’t need you to share details — but if you want to walk somewhere quiet after work, I’m here. You don’t have to be strong all the time.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying everything’s fine, but I see how tired you are and how hard you’re forcing smiles. You used to laugh so easily, and now you just look drained. I don’t know what’s going on at work, but if you even think about quitting everything to heal, I’ll help you. Your heart matters more than any job.
Follow-up on wellbeing assessment Based on your anonymous survey responses, there are clear indicators of prolonged emotional distress affecting your daily functioning. While I cannot diagnose, I strongly recommend engaging with the company’s mental health program before burnout escalates. This is not a performance issue — it’s a human one, and the organization has resources designed precisely for this.
Need some time off – personal matters Things have been really hard for me lately. After everything that happened, I just hit a point where I couldn’t keep up with work. I’m struggling to sleep, to focus, and to feel like myself. I’m not asking for a long break, just a few days to get my head straight. I promise I’ll make up the time once I’m back on my feet.
Following up on your request for leave I understand you’ve been going through a difficult emotional period and I want to support you through this. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now. Please take the time you need—there’s no rush to return until you feel ready. Let me know if you’d like help connecting with EAP resources.
Confidential: Support resources available We’ve noticed you’ve been absent from team check-ins and wanted to reach out privately. Many people face moments of intense emotional strain, and you’re not alone. Our confidential counselling service is available 24/7, and we can arrange a quiet space for you to speak with someone. You don’t have to go through this alone.
I’m not okay – need help I’ve been carrying this weight for weeks and I don’t know how to talk about it. I cry at my desk, I forget simple tasks, and I feel like I’m falling apart inside. I don’t want to lose my job, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I need help, and I’m scared to ask.
He’s not sleeping… can you help? My son has been working overtime for months and lately he hasn’t been answering calls. He says he’s tired, but I think it’s more than that. He used to be full of life, now he just sits in silence. I don’t know who else to turn to—can you check in on him? He trusts the company more than he lets on.
Re: Employee wellness check-in In my review of engagement patterns, I’ve observed a concerning decline in participation from several team members. These aren’t just performance issues—they’re indicators of deep personal distress. Many are experiencing burnout that borders on emotional collapse. I recommend immediate psychological safety interventions, not just flexible hours.
Quick request – I need to talk I’ve been holding it together for so long, but today I just broke down in the bathroom. I didn’t want to scare anyone, but I can’t keep pretending I’m fine. The grief, the anxiety, the constant dread—it’s too much. I know this isn’t typical workplace talk, but I need someone to listen, even if it’s just for five minutes.
Need some time off — I’m not ok I’ve been trying to push through, but I’m mentally exhausted and can’t focus at work anymore. Every morning feels like a battle just to get out of bed. I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending everything’s fine when I’m drowning in emotional pain.
Follow-up on your recent request I appreciate you sharing how deeply you’ve been affected by ongoing stress at home. It’s clear this isn’t just a passing phase — the weight you’re carrying is impacting your ability to engage fully. Our EAP program can connect you with a counselor who specializes in chronic emotional distress. Please let me know if you’d like the referral details sent today.
Checking in after your absence last week I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual and missed a few team check-ins. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know it’s okay to say you’re not okay. Many of us have been through something similar and didn’t reach out until it was too late. If you’d prefer to talk privately, my door is always open.
Can we talk about my leave options? I’ve been dealing with a personal crisis that’s made it impossible to maintain my usual performance. I’m not sleeping, I’m constantly overwhelmed, and I’ve started missing deadlines without being able to explain why. I don’t want to let the team down, but I need space to recover before I can show up as myself again.
Confidential wellness consultation request I’m reaching out on behalf of a client who is experiencing profound emotional distress that’s interfering with daily work life. The individual describes persistent feelings of hopelessness and an inability to cope with routine responsibilities. While they haven’t formally requested accommodation, they’ve hinted at needing support beyond what standard policies offer.
I don’t know who else to tell I’ve been keeping this to myself for months, but I can’t keep acting like I’m fine at work. Some days I cry in the bathroom stall just to get through the hour. I don’t want anyone to think I’m weak, but I’m terrified I’ll break down during a meeting. I need someone who gets it without judging me.
Requesting flexible hours for the next few weeks I’ve been managing a lot on the home front and it’s taking a heavy toll on my mental wellbeing. Some mornings I just sit in my car before coming in because I can’t face the office yet. I’m not asking for special treatment — just the chance to adjust my schedule so I don’t collapse under the pressure. I promise I’ll deliver on everything, just not always at 9am.
Need some time off — personal matters I’ve been going through a really tough time since losing my position last month. The emotional toll has been overwhelming, and I’m struggling to keep up with daily tasks. I don’t want to make excuses, but I need a few days to regroup and see a counselor. I’ll be back as soon as I can, and I’ll catch up on everything once I’m settled.
Following up on your recent request I understand you’ve been dealing with a major personal setback after your layoff, and I want you to know the team supports you. Mental health matters just as much as productivity, and we’re here to help you navigate this. Please take all the time you need — there’s no rush. I’ve flagged your case for HR to arrange extended leave options.
Confidential: Emotional Support Resources Available We’ve noticed some changes in your recent attendance and engagement, and we want to offer you access to our Employee Assistance Program. Many people experience profound emotional turmoil after job transitions, and you’re not alone. Our counselors are available 24/7 for confidential conversations. You don’t have to face this alone — we’re here to listen, not judge.
Just checking in I heard what happened with your role ending, and I just wanted to say I’m really sorry. I went through something similar last year — the silence after the office doors close hits harder than you’d think. I’ve been seeing a therapist, and it’s made a difference. If you ever want to grab coffee or just vent, I’m here. No pressure, just know you’re not isolated.
Request for private meeting — urgent personal matter I’m writing to ask for a private meeting with you, as I’m facing a situation I’m not comfortable discussing over email. My mental health has deteriorated significantly since my partner and I separated, and the job instability has made it worse. I need to discuss possible adjustments to my workload or temporary remote安排. I know this is unconventional, but I’m at a breaking point.
Wellbeing initiative follow-up — your input needed As part of our organisational wellbeing audit, we’re gathering anonymized insights into how employees cope with sudden career disruption. Many report deep emotional strain, isolation, and a sense of identity loss after redundancy. Your experience, even if brief, could help us design better support systems. Nothing is shared beyond our team, and your voice matters.
Can you talk? I’ve been worried ever since you stopped answering calls. I know you’ve been trying to stay strong, but I can hear it in your voice — you’re carrying a heavy weight. Losing your job wasn’t just a career change, it was a blow to your whole sense of self. I’m not asking you to fix it now. Just let me sit with you, even in silence. You don’t have to be okay for anyone but yourself.
I need some time off — I’m not okay I’ve been holding it together for weeks, but the weight of everything is crushing me. I can’t sleep, I can’t focus, and I keep crying at my desk. I don’t know how to ask for help, but I can’t keep pretending I’m fine. I need to step away for a few days — not for vacation, but to breathe.
Follow-up: Emotional Wellbeing Support Resources I noticed your recent request for leave and wanted to personally check in. You’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed, and it takes real courage to admit when things are too much. Our Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counselling sessions, 24/7, and I can help you book one today. Your mental health matters as much as your work output.
Let’s talk — I’ve noticed you’ve seemed distant I don’t know if you realize it, but you’ve been quieter lately, and your usual energy isn’t there. I’m not asking as your boss — I’m asking as someone who cares. If something’s weighing on you, I’m here to listen, no judgment. We can adjust deadlines, redistribute tasks, or just find a quiet place to talk over coffee.
I’m in a bad place and need support Lately, every morning feels like climbing a mountain I didn’t sign up for. I’m exhausted from the silence inside my head and the fear that no one would understand. I’ve stopped texting friends because I don’t want to burden anyone. I know there are resources — I just didn’t know how to reach for them until now.
I don’t know who else to turn to I’ve been holding it together at work, but at home, I’m falling apart. I cry in the shower so no one hears me. I don’t trust myself to make decisions anymore, let alone show up for meetings. I’m scared to tell HR because I don’t want anyone to think I’m weak — but I can’t do this alone.
My team member is struggling — can we help? I’m reaching out as a contractor who’s worked closely with one of your team members. They’ve become withdrawn, miss deadlines without explanation, and seem emotionally drained. I’m not their manager, but I care — and I suspect they’re carrying something heavy they can’t name. I hope you can offer quiet, compassionate support before this escalates.
Urgent: I need to talk about something private I’ve been dealing with a slow-burning emotional crisis that’s seeped into every part of my life. I can’t concentrate, I’m snapping at colleagues, and I feel like I’m disappearing. I don’t want to be on leave or seen as a problem — I just need someone to listen, without solutions, without advice. Can we meet tomorrow? I’m terrified to say this out loud.
Need some time off — I’m not okay I’ve been struggling to get through each day lately. The weight of everything has become too much to carry alone. I’m not sleeping, I’m not eating properly, and I’m visibly falling apart at work. I know this isn’t typical, but I need to step away for a bit to get professional help before it gets worse.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you’ve seemed distant over the past few weeks, and I want you to know I’m here to support you. If you’re going through something personal, please don’t feel you have to tough it out on your own. Our EAP program is confidential and available 24/7 — you’re not a burden for reaching out.
Resources available for emotional well-being We’ve observed increased absenteeism and reduced engagement in your team recently. This isn’t uncommon during periods of intense emotional strain. You’re not expected to handle everything alone. Our confidential counseling services are designed specifically for employees experiencing emotional turmoil, and we encourage you to connect with them.
Just checking in I’ve noticed you haven’t been yourself lately, and I just wanted to say I’m here if you want to talk. I’ve been through something similar last year — it’s exhausting pretending everything’s fine when it’s not. You don’t have to explain anything, but please don’t isolate yourself.
Request to speak privately — urgent I’ve been dealing with some deep personal issues that are starting to impact my performance. I’ve tried to push through, but I’m at a point where I can’t keep faking it. I don’t want to disappoint the team, but I need to be honest about what’s going on so I can get the right support. I’m not asking for special treatment — just understanding.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve seen how tired you look and how quiet you’ve become. This isn’t just stress — it’s something heavier. You don’t have to tell me everything, but please don’t try to fix this on your own. I’ve found a therapist who specializes in emotional burnout — I can send you their info if you’re ready.
Observations on team mental health trends Over the past month, I’ve seen a pattern of declining participation and increased withdrawal among several team members. These are not performance issues — they’re signs of unresolved emotional distress. In my experience, early intervention through internal support channels prevents long-term attrition and trauma. I strongly recommend proactive outreach.
I’m struggling to keep up and need support Lately I’ve been carrying a heavy emotional load that’s starting to affect my work. I’m not sleeping well and find myself overwhelmed by daily tasks that used to feel manageable. I know this isn’t ideal timing, but I need to talk to someone about what I’m going through before things get worse.
Follow-up on your recent request Thank you for reaching out about the difficulties you’ve been experiencing personally. We take these matters seriously and want to ensure you have access to our EAP resources. Please let us know a time that works for a private conversation this week so we can explore options together. Your wellbeing matters to us.
Checking in after your last week I noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings and haven’t submitted your reports on time. I’m not here to judge—I just want to make sure you’re okay. If there’s something personal going on that’s impacting your focus, I’m open to listening. We can adjust workload or deadlines if needed.
Can we chat about a personal issue? I’ve been dealing with a lot internally that I haven’t shared at work, but it’s becoming hard to hide. I feel like I’m falling apart emotionally and don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending everything’s fine. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m at a point where I need help.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve noticed how distant you’ve been lately. You’re not sleeping, you’re canceling plans, and your voice sounds tired all the time. I’m not asking you to explain everything—but please consider talking to someone at work who can help. I care too much to watch you suffer alone.
Supporting team wellbeing during transition As we navigate these organizational changes, many employees are experiencing unnoticed emotional strain. I’ve seen cases where people bottle up stress until it impacts performance or attendance. Offering confidential channels for personal concerns isn’t just compassionate—it’s a risk mitigation strategy. Consider amplifying internal support messaging.
Need to take a few days off—personal reasons I’m not well and need to step away for a few days to deal with something deeply personal. This isn’t something I’m comfortable elaborating on over email, but I promise it’s not frivolous. I’ve attached a doctor’s note and will be reachable only in emergencies. Thank you for understanding during this time.
I need to take some time off I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because of everything that’s happened personally. I’m not sure how to say this without sounding dramatic, but I’m going through a deep emotional turmoil and I need space to heal. I’ve spoken to my therapist and they’ve recommended a short leave to stabilize. I’m not asking for a long absence—just enough time to get back on my feet. I’ll make sure everything is covered before I go.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’ve been facing some personal challenges that have impacted your focus at work. It’s clear this isn’t just a rough patch—it’s a personal crisis that requires attention beyond the office. I want you to know we support you and will accommodate whatever you need to recover. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to HR if you’d like help navigating leave options or counseling resources. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Requesting flexible hours temporarily Lately, I’ve been overwhelmed by the weight of what I’ve been carrying outside of work. It’s not something I can just shake off, and it’s starting to affect my ability to concentrate during the day. I’m not looking for special treatment—just a temporary adjustment so I can manage my mental health without falling further behind. I’ve already talked to my team about redistributing some tasks. I appreciate your understanding more than I can say.
Confidential support resources available We’ve noticed a pattern of decreased engagement among several team members recently, and we want to make sure everyone has access to the right support. If you’re dealing with emotional pain, a breakdown, or just feel like you’re barely holding on, you’re not alone. Our Employee Assistance Program offers free, confidential counseling 24/7. You don’t need to explain anything to us—you just need to call. This is for you, no questions asked.
Re: Wellness initiative feedback I’ve been reviewing internal communications and saw several employees mentioning personal struggles that aren’t being addressed proactively. Many are silently dealing with emotional turmoil because they fear judgment or repercussions. This isn’t just about productivity—it’s about human dignity. I recommend we normalize conversations around mental health by training managers to respond with compassion, not policies. The culture we cultivate now will define retention long-term.
I don’t know how to ask for help I’ve been pretending everything’s fine for weeks, but I’m not okay. The pressure at home and the silence at work have left me feeling hollow. I don’t want to be a burden, but I can’t keep pretending I can handle it all. I’m scared to say it out loud, but I think I need professional help—and maybe a break from the office. I know this isn’t easy to hear, but I’m finally brave enough to admit it.
Urgent: Please call me I’m writing because I’m worried about you. You haven’t answered calls in three days, and your messages have been short and exhausted. I know you’ve been trying to be strong, but I’ve seen the cracks. You’re not alone in this—your emotional pain doesn’t make you weak. I’m here, no matter what you’re going through. Please let me help you find someone to talk to. Your life matters more than your workload.
Need some time off — things are overwhelming I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because I’m going through a really tough time emotionally. The last few weeks have been unbearable, and I don’t feel like I can function at my best. I’m not asking for sympathy, just a little space to get my head straight so I can come back stronger.
Following up on your request for leave I heard from HR that you’ve been dealing with personal challenges, and I want you to know I’m here to support you. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now. Please take all the time you need — we’ll cover your responsibilities until you’re ready to return.
Confidential: Emotional Support Resources Available We’ve noticed increased stress signals in recent team check-ins and want to remind you that our Employee Assistance Program offers free, confidential counseling. Many employees have found it helpful during periods of emotional turmoil, especially after major life events. You don’t have to go through this alone, and no one will know you reached out unless you choose to share.
Just checking in… I know things have been rough since the team reshuffle, and I just wanted to say I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter than usual. You don’t have to explain anything, but if you ever want to grab coffee or just vent, I’m here. Sometimes putting words to how you feel helps, even if it’s just to an empty room.
Request to adjust deadlines — personal situation I’m writing to ask if we can shift the deadline for the Q3 report by a week. Something deeply personal has come up and I’m dealing with a lot of inner turmoil that’s affecting my focus. I’m not absenting myself — I’m working, but slowly and with heavy hearts. I’ll keep you updated if anything changes.
Re: Your wellbeing assessment Based on your responses in the confidential survey, it’s clear you’re experiencing significant emotional strain, likely tied to workplace pressure. You’re not overreacting — what you’re describing aligns with burnout patterns we see often in high-stakes roles. I strongly recommend scheduling a session with our on-site counselor before things escalate further.
I’m worried about you Mom told me you haven’t been sleeping and you’ve stopped answering calls. I know you always say you’re fine, but I can hear it in your voice when you do talk. You don’t have to carry this alone — I’m not asking for details, just please let someone in before it gets worse. I love you and I’m here.
I need some time off – things are overwhelming I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately, and it’s not just about workload. I’m going through a really tough emotional period and I don’t feel like I can perform at my best. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a short leave to get some space and professional help. I know this isn’t easy to hear, but I need to prioritize my mental health before things get worse.
Following up on your note about personal challenges I want to thank you for being honest about what you’re going through. It takes courage to speak up, especially in a high-pressure environment. Please know that our EAP program is available 24/7, and I’ve already reached out to HR to arrange a confidential session with a counselor. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now.
Support resources for personal hardship We’ve been made aware that you’re navigating a difficult time and want to ensure you’re not facing it alone. Our confidential support line is staffed by licensed therapists who specialize in emotional crises. You can access counseling, financial advice, or even just someone to listen without any record being shared with your manager. You deserve care, not judgment.
Just checking in – you’ve been quiet I noticed you haven’t been around in team chats and I just wanted to say I’m here if you need to talk. I’ve been through something similar last year and it took me months to feel like myself again. You don’t have to explain anything, but if you want to grab coffee or even just vent, I’ve got time.
Request for flexibility – personal situation I’m currently managing a lot on the home front and it’s affecting my ability to meet deadlines consistently. I’m not making excuses, but I need to adjust my schedule for a few weeks to handle urgent family matters. I’ll make sure all critical tasks are covered, and I’m happy to document my plan if that helps. I appreciate your understanding during this time.
Confidential inquiry regarding employee wellbeing protocol I’m working with your HR team on a wellbeing initiative and came across a case where an employee described feeling emotionally shattered after a prolonged period of isolation. Can you confirm whether your internal guidelines allow for immediate access to trauma-informed support without requiring a formal diagnosis? The sensitivity here is critical.
Please help – [Employee Name] needs support I’m writing because I’m very worried about [Employee Name] and I don’t know who else to turn to. They haven’t slept properly in days and keep saying they’re ‘broken inside.’ I know this isn’t workplace policy, but they’re afraid to ask for help at work. If there’s any way your team can reach out gently, I’d be forever grateful.
Need some time off — personal reasons Emotional turmoil is making it hard to sleep, and I’ve been struggling to focus during work hours. I don’t want to let the team down, but I’m at a point where I need to step back for a few days. I’ve spoken to my GP and they’ve recommended short-term leave to regain stability. I’ll keep you updated on my progress and am happy to help transition any urgent tasks before I go.
Request for flexible hours — personal health I’ve been dealing with intense psychological strain that’s affecting my daily routine and energy levels. It’s not something I talk about often, but I need to adjust my schedule to attend therapy and rest properly. I can still meet deadlines, but I’d need to start later and work later to accommodate my needs. I appreciate your understanding — this isn’t a phase, it’s something I’m actively managing.
Follow-up on your recent well-being note I noticed your message about feeling overwhelmed and wanted to check in properly. You don’t have to explain all the details, but I want you to know support is available through our EAP. Many of us carry invisible burdens, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. If you’d like to talk more, I’m here — or we can arrange a private meeting with HR.
Just wanted to say I get it I’ve been in the same place — nights spent staring at the ceiling, heart racing for no reason, body exhausted but mind too wired to rest. It’s not just stress, it’s deeper than that. I started seeing a counsellor last month, and it’s changed how I cope. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to admit you’re not okay. Let me know if you want to grab coffee sometime — no pressure.

Please know your privacy is maintained, and you are not required to disclose anything to your manager. Our EAP offers free, confidential sessions with licensed therapists available 24/7. Many employees use this service to navigate personal challenges without stigma. You deserve support, and we’re here to ensure you get it.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been holding it together at work, but lately I’ve been breaking down after hours — crying over small things, unable to eat, feeling completely numb. It’s not depression, not exactly, but it’s close. I don’t want to be seen as unreliable, but I can’t pretend this isn’t happening. Can we schedule a quiet chat? I just need someone to hear me without judgment.
Need some time off for personal reasons I’ve been going through a really tough time emotionally lately, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’ve made an appointment with a counselor to help me work through some deep personal struggles. I’m not sure how long I’ll need, but I’d appreciate any flexibility you can offer while I get back on my feet.
Follow-up on your recent leave request We received your message about emotional turmoil impacting your daily functioning, and we take this seriously. Our EAP provider has been contacted and can offer confidential sessions this week. Please know your privacy is protected—this will not be documented beyond standard HR welfare records. Your wellbeing is our priority.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual since returning from your time off, and I wanted to make sure you’re okay. Everyone here understands that personal hardships can be overwhelming, and we’re not here to judge. If you need to adjust your workload or just talk, I’m available anytime.
Can we talk in private? I’ve been struggling with anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed to the point where I can barely sleep. It’s not just stress—it’s something deeper I haven’t been able to shake. I’m seeing a therapist now, and I’d like to discuss how I might adjust my schedule to accommodate appointments without it affecting my performance.
Feedback on employee wellness initiative Several team members have shared that the recent mental health outreach was the first time they felt safe disclosing personal hardship at work. One individual described a prolonged emotional breakdown that had gone unspoken for over a year. This suggests a real need for ongoing, low-pressure channels for disclosure.
I’m worried about her She’s been crying every night and barely answering her phone. I know she’s afraid to tell anyone at work, but she’s not eating, not sleeping, and says she feels like she’s breaking inside. I don’t know who else to reach out to—she’s your employee, and I’m scared something worse will happen if no one notices.
Your wellness survey response was flagged Your recent submission indicated prolonged emotional pain and difficulty coping with daily tasks. Based on company policy, we’ve automatically enrolled you in our confidential mental health support program. A trained counselor will contact you within 48 hours. You do not need to reply—this is not a request for confirmation, but an offer of care.
I’m struggling to keep up I’ve been trying to push through, but the emotional burden has become unbearable. I don’t sleep well anymore, and even small tasks feel like mountains. I know work is important, but I need time to breathe before I break down completely.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’re dealing with intense personal stress and wanted to check in properly. Your well-being matters more than any deadline, and we can arrange temporary adjustments if needed. Please let me know what kind of support would help you feel stable again.
Need to talk about my situation Lately, I’ve been overwhelmed by feelings I can’t shake off, even after hours away from the office. I’m not sleeping, I’m irritable, and I’m afraid I’m letting everyone down. I don’t want to quit, but I don’t know how much longer I can carry this weight alone.
Please let me know how I can help I noticed you’ve seemed distant lately, and I’m concerned. You don’t have to explain everything, but if something is weighing on you personally, I’m here to listen. Your mental health isn’t a liability—it’s part of being human.
Can we talk? I’ve been holding it together for so long, but it’s starting to crack. I cry in the shower, I skip meals, and I feel like I’m fading inside. I don’t know who else to turn to, and I’m scared to say it out loud. Please don’t ignore this.
Support options for your team member The individual you referred me to is experiencing significant emotional distress that impacts daily function. They need access to confidential counseling and flexible scheduling, not performance pressure. This isn’t laziness—it’s a cry for structural support.
I need to take a step back I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety that has nothing to do with my workload, but everything to do with my home life. I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I can’t focus and I’m afraid I’ll make a mistake that costs someone else. I need a short leave, not a reprimand.
Need to take some personal time I’ve been struggling to cope with the pressure lately, and it’s started affecting my sleep and focus at work. The emotional toll has become too much to handle on my own, and I’m not sure how much longer I can keep up this pace. I’m reaching out because I need to step back for a few days to get some professional support and just breathe again.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’ve been going through a difficult time emotionally, and I want you to know your well-being matters here. You don’t have to explain everything, but I’m glad you felt comfortable sharing enough to ask for space. Please take whatever time you need — your health comes before deadlines.
Confidential support resources available We’ve noticed a pattern of increased absenteeism and reduced engagement in your team, and we want to offer you confidential counseling resources. Many employees face overwhelming emotional strain without realizing how common it is. You are not alone, and we’re here to help you navigate this without judgment or record.
Can we talk privately? Lately I’ve been feeling completely drained, like every morning I’m fighting to get out of bed. It’s not just work — it’s everything. I’ve started seeing a therapist, but I’m still scared to tell anyone how bad it’s gotten. I’m not asking for sympathy, just understanding while I work through this.
Supporting team wellbeing during restructuring As we move through this transition phase, many team members are experiencing quiet but severe emotional distress. They may not speak up, but signs include withdrawal, missed deadlines, or sudden silence in meetings. Offering safe channels for personal communication isn’t optional — it’s essential to retention and morale.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been trying to act like everything’s fine, but I’ve heard the way you talk on the phone — tired, quiet, like you’re carrying the world. You don’t have to tough this out alone. If work is making you feel this broken, maybe it’s time to let go of the guilt and prioritize yourself. I’m here, no matter what.
Request for sensitivity around my absence I’ve had to take a few unscheduled days off, and I know it’s caused ripples. I’m dealing with something deeply personal that I’m not ready to share broadly, but I promise I’m taking steps to heal. I’m not looking for special treatment — just the dignity of not being questioned every time I step out.
Need some time off to focus on my mental health I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload lately, and I realize it’s because I’m carrying a lot of emotional weight. I’ve started seeing a counselor regularly, and they’ve recommended I take a short leave to fully reset. This isn’t something I’m proud to admit, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’d appreciate your understanding and support as I work toward getting better.
Following up on your request for support I want you to know that I take your message about feeling overwhelmed seriously, and your willingness to speak up is brave. Many people in our team are dealing with unseen pressures, and I’m glad you reached out. I’ve arranged for you to connect with our EAP provider this week — they specialize in anxiety and burnout. Please don’t hesitate to ask for more time if you need it.
Confidential: Resources for emotional well-being As part of our commitment to employee wellness, I wanted to share a list of vetted mental health professionals who offer confidential sessions during work hours. If you’re feeling persistently low, anxious, or emotionally drained, you’re not alone, and help is available without judgment. Our records are strictly private — this is not tracked in performance reviews. You deserve care, and we’re here to help you access it.
Can I work remotely next week? I’ve been dealing with a lot of internal stress lately, and being in the office is making it harder to breathe. I’ve started working with a therapist to manage my symptoms, and they’ve suggested I try working from home for a bit to stabilize. I’ll keep all my deadlines and be fully available online. This isn’t a phase — it’s part of my long-term recovery.
I don’t know who else to tell I’ve been having panic attacks in the bathroom at work, and I’m terrified someone will notice. I don’t even know how to ask for help without sounding weak. I’ve been waking up at 3am crying and scrolling through therapy blogs, wondering if I’m broken. I just need someone to say it’s okay to not be okay.
Supporting your team through emotional distress Many employees are silently managing depression or anxiety, especially after recent restructuring. Your leadership in normalizing conversations about mental strain can reduce turnover and build trust. I recommend sharing a list of licensed counselors who accept insurance — not just generic helplines. People won’t reach out unless they feel safe, and they won’t feel safe unless they see you lead by example.
Request for flexible schedule adjustment I’ve been seeing a specialist for chronic anxiety, and they’ve asked me to avoid high-stimulus environments during peak hours. I’m not asking for time off — just the ability to shift my schedule to avoid the busiest parts of the day. It’s not about laziness; it’s about survival. If I don’t make this adjustment, I’m afraid I’ll burn out completely.
Need to adjust my weekly schedule I’ve been going through a tough time personally and have found that meeting with a mental health professional each week has made a real difference. These appointments are non-negotiable for my wellbeing, and I’m grateful for the flexibility you’ve shown so far. I’ll keep you updated if anything changes, but I’d appreciate continued support in keeping this time blocked.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I noticed you’ve been taking time off midweek and wanted to check in privately. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know that seeking professional help for stress or emotional wellbeing is completely understood here. Your performance hasn’t slipped, and your honesty about needing space speaks volumes. Please let HR know if you need additional resources.
Confidential resource guide for emotional wellness As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, we’ve compiled a list of accredited therapists and low-cost counseling services available through our partner network. Many employees have found these sessions invaluable during periods of high pressure or personal grief. All referrals are confidential and do not appear on any personnel record. You’re not alone in this.
Quick request about remote work I’ve been working with a therapist to manage some lingering anxiety, and having consistent quiet time at home has been essential to my progress. I know the policy says two days remote, but I’m hoping we can extend that to three this month. It’s not about laziness—it’s about creating space to heal. I’ll make up any missed collaboration time.
Re: Employee Assistance Program feedback Several team members have quietly mentioned that they’re attending regular sessions with licensed counselors, and they credit it with helping them stay engaged and productive. The stigma around mental health support is fading, but only when leadership normalizes it. I’d recommend adding testimonials like these to your internal comms—it’s making a difference.
Can we talk later? I’ve been seeing someone for depression over the past few months, and it’s still hard to talk about it even with people I trust. I don’t need advice, just someone to listen without judgment. I know you’ve been through something similar, and I thought maybe we could have coffee—somewhere quiet—this week. No pressure, just… if you’re up for it.
Request for private meeting I’ve been struggling more than I let on and started counseling last month. I don’t want this to affect how you see me, but I need to ask for some leniency on deadlines next quarter while I stabilize. I’m not asking for special treatment—just time. My therapist suggested I be upfront with my manager, and you’re the only person I trust enough to tell.
Taking some time off for personal health reasons I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the past few months and have decided to start therapy to work through some persistent anxiety. I’m not sure how long this will take, but I’d appreciate some flexibility in my schedule as I begin regular sessions. I want to be upfront about this because I care about my work and don’t want to let the team down.
Follow-up on confidential wellbeing request Thank you for sharing your experience with depression and the need for ongoing counseling. We’ve noted your request for adjusted working hours and will coordinate with your manager to ensure minimal disruption. Your confidentiality is paramount, and this information will not be shared beyond the wellbeing team. Please let us know if you’d like access to our Employee Assistance Program resources.
Request for remote work adjustment Lately, I’ve been managing my mental health with weekly sessions with a licensed therapist, and it’s helping me feel more stable. Being able to work from home on those days reduces my stress significantly and lets me follow through with treatment without rushing. I’ve attached a note from my provider if needed, and I’m happy to discuss how this can work long term.
Check-in regarding your recent leave I noticed you’ve been taking a few afternoons off lately and wanted to make sure everything’s okay. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know I see how hard you’re working even while managing personal challenges. Your well-being matters more than perfect attendance.
Can we talk this weekend? I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and I finally started seeing someone to talk through my depression and panic attacks. It’s scary opening up, but I know I need this. I don’t want to burden you, but I’ve been feeling too isolated and I think I need to lean on people I trust.
Re: Wellness Program Enrollment Based on your self-reporting during the recent wellbeing survey, I recommend you enroll in our trauma-informed counseling initiative. Many participants report reduced anxiety and improved focus after just six weeks of structured support. This is not a performance issue—it’s a care issue, and our program is entirely confidential.
Need to step away for a few hours I’m working through some heavy stuff right now and my therapist suggested I take short breaks during the day to ground myself. I know it’s unusual to ask, but I’m not well enough to push through without these pauses. I’m not asking for sympathy—I’m asking for understanding while I get stable again.
Need to adjust my schedule next week I’ve been working with a mental health professional to manage some ongoing stress, and they’ve suggested I incorporate daily breathing exercises into my routine. I’d appreciate if we could shift my afternoon meetings to earlier in the day so I can block out 20 minutes for this. It’s not a cure-all, but it’s helping me stay grounded during high-pressure weeks. I’m not looking for special treatment, just a small adjustment to support my wellbeing.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’ve been dealing with some personal challenges related to your mental health, and I want to acknowledge how brave it is to prioritize self-care in this environment. The mindfulness techniques you mentioned are well-supported by research, and I’m glad you’ve found a resource that works for you. Please let me know if you’d like me to help coordinate coverage during your quiet hours. Your performance hasn’t slipped, and your honesty matters more than you know.
EAP resources and confidential support options As part of our commitment to employee wellbeing, we encourage you to explore our confidential counseling program, which includes licensed specialists trained in anxiety and depression support. Many employees find that structured sessions help them regain focus and emotional balance during demanding periods. You don’t need to disclose details to us — your use of this benefit is entirely private. If you’re unsure where to start, I can connect you with a counselor who speaks your language.
Quick favor — can we reschedule? I’ve been seeing someone for my anxiety and they’ve got me doing some grounding techniques every morning to calm my nervous system. It’s making a real difference, but I need to do it before my first call. Could we push my 9 a.m. sync to 9:30? I’m not asking for a pattern — just one week to get into a rhythm. I know it’s a small ask, but this is the first time I’ve felt like I’m not drowning.
Feedback on your wellbeing initiative I’ve noticed a growing number of staff reaching out to access internal support services, especially around emotional fatigue and burnout. This isn’t just a trend — it’s a systemic signal that people are finally feeling safe enough to ask for help. Programs that normalize therapy, journaling, or even just scheduled silence are proving more effective than any wellness seminar. The organization’s credibility is rising because of this.
Just checking in I know you’ve been going through a rough patch with the panic attacks, and I’m so proud of you for reaching out to a counselor instead of pushing through alone. The breathing exercises you told me about remind me of what my aunt did after her surgery — small, quiet things that saved her. You don’t have to talk about it with anyone else, but I’m here if you need a walk or a quiet coffee in the morning. I miss you, but I also see you fighting.
Urgent: Personal time request — Friday My depression has worsened over the past month, and my clinician has advised me to take one full day off to reset without work contact. This isn’t a vacation — it’s part of my treatment plan. I’ve attached the note from my provider, but I’d prefer not to share the details with the team. I’ve caught up on everything before Friday, and I’ll be available Monday morning. Thank you for respecting this. I don’t ask for much, but this is essential.
Need to take some time off for personal reasons I’ve been dealing with some ongoing emotional challenges lately and I need to step away for a few days to focus on my well-being. This isn’t something I’m comfortable discussing in detail, but it’s affecting my ability to perform at my best. I’ve attached my medical note and will coordinate with the team to cover my pending tasks. I appreciate your understanding during this time.
Follow-up on your recent leave request Thank you for sharing your need for time off to address personal health concerns. Our EAP program offers confidential counseling sessions that may provide additional support during this period. Please know that your privacy is protected under company policy and no details will be shared beyond what’s necessary for accommodation. If you’d like help connecting with a licensed provider, I’m happy to assist.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been quieter lately and wanted to make sure you’re okay. Work can feel overwhelming when you’re carrying things alone, and it’s okay to ask for help. Your team has been covering for you without complaint, and I want you to know we care about you as a person, not just an employee. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to make things easier.
Can we talk about adjusting my workload? I’ve been struggling to keep up with deadlines because of a persistent low mood that’s been affecting my concentration. It’s not laziness or disengagement—this is something I’m actively working on with a therapist. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a temporary reduction in non-critical assignments. I’ve been honest with my doctor and they’ve confirmed this is medically warranted.
Resources for mental wellness in the workplace Many of our clients are seeing a rise in requests for flexible schedules due to emotional strain, and it’s not always visible. Supporting employees through psychological distress isn’t a perk—it’s a retention and compliance issue. We recommend embedding access to certified counselors into your benefits package, not as an afterthought but as core infrastructure. This reduces absenteeism and builds psychological safety.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet since you started that new job and I want you to know I’m here. You don’t have to pretend everything’s fine just because you’re not crying in front of people. I’ve been through something similar and I know how hard it is to admit you need help. If you want to talk, I’ll listen. No advice, no pressure—just space.
Confession: I’m not okay I’ve been hiding how bad I’ve been feeling and I’m tired of pretending. Some days I can barely get out of bed and I’m terrified someone will notice. I’ve been seeing a counselor twice a week, but I still feel like I’m failing. I don’t need to be fixed—I just need to not be judged for needing to breathe sometimes. I’m writing this because I can’t say it out loud yet.
Need to talk about taking some time off I’ve been feeling overwhelmed for a while now and it’s starting to affect my work. I don’t know how to say this without sounding weak, but I think I need to see someone professionally. The nights are long and I keep crying for no reason. I’m not asking for a leave of absence yet, but I need to know what options are available through the EAP.
Following up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned feeling emotionally drained during our last check-in, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You’re not alone in this — many of us have been through similar phases. I’ve already reached out to HR about confidential counseling resources. Please don’t hesitate to ask for a quiet space or adjusted deadlines if you need them.
Mental health support resources available to you We’ve noticed an uptick in requests for emotional wellness support and wanted to proactively share what’s available. Our partnered therapists offer free, anonymous sessions via phone or video. Many employees have found relief through weekly check-ins, even if they don’t yet have a diagnosis. This isn’t about performance — it’s about sustainability.
Can we chat about my workload? Lately I’ve had trouble getting out of bed before noon, and it’s not just tiredness. I’ve been seeing a counselor through the company’s program, and they suggested I try reducing my hours temporarily. I know it’s a lot to ask, but I’m trying to get better, not just survive. I’d appreciate your support more than you know.
Wellness initiative feedback from the team Several team members have privately shared that they’re experiencing symptoms of chronic stress and emotional exhaustion. One said they’ve stopped answering texts from friends because they “can’t fake being okay.” Others mentioned having panic attacks before Zoom calls. We recommend immediate rollout of trauma-informed management training.
I’m worried about you I saw your last message and it sounded so hollow, like you were just going through the motions. You used to love hiking and cooking, and now you barely leave the house. I’m not your boss, but I’m your sister — I’ve been through this too. The therapist I saw helped me more than any pill ever did. Please, just try one session.
Temporary adjustment request I’ve been dealing with persistent low moods and brain fog that make it hard to focus during meetings. I’ve started medication and therapy, but the side effects mean I need to avoid late calls for a few weeks. I’m not asking for special treatment — just a small window of flexibility while I work through this. I promise to keep my deliverables on track.
Need to discuss my mental health leave Lately I’ve been struggling with overwhelming panic episodes that are making it hard to focus at work. I’ve started seeing a licensed counselor and they’ve recommended some time off to stabilize my condition. I’m not sure how to proceed with HR policies but I’d appreciate guidance on leave options without stigma.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned feeling emotionally drained and having trouble sleeping during our last check-in. I want to assure you that our EAP program is confidential and includes access to professional therapists. Please don’t hesitate to use it—I’ve seen how it helped others in similar situations. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline.
Confidential support resources available As part of our commitment to employee wellbeing, we’ve expanded access to mental health counseling services this quarter. Many team members are now using these benefits to manage stress-related symptoms like constant worry and emotional exhaustion. You can book sessions anonymously through our portal, and all records are protected under HIPAA and GDPR.
Can we talk about my workload? I’ve been having daily episodes of intense dread that leave me paralyzed before noon. It’s not just fatigue—it’s a physical heaviness that comes with chest tightness and rapid breathing. I’ve been too ashamed to say anything until now, but I think I need to pause some assignments.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried something’s going on. You’ve mentioned feeling like you’re drowning under pressure and not sleeping at night. I’m not asking for details, but please consider talking to someone trained to help—this isn’t something you should carry alone.
Re: Wellbeing Initiative Feedback Several participants in our mental wellness pilot described recurring bouts of emotional collapse and an inability to disengage from work thoughts. One individual noted that even small tasks triggered full-blown distress reactions. These reactions are not signs of weakness—they’re clinical indicators that require structured support.
Urgent: I need to step away for a bit The constant tension in my body has turned into uncontrollable shaking at my desk. I’m not okay and I can’t pretend I am anymore. I’ve been avoiding telling anyone because I feared being seen as unreliable, but I’m at the point where continuing is harming me. Please help me find a path to pause this.
Just wanted to share something personal I’ve been struggling with my anxiety for months now, and I finally started seeing someone remotely. It’s not easy to talk about, but the weekly sessions have helped me breathe again. I’m not asking for anything special—just hoping you understand if I need a little more flexibility in my schedule. This isn’t something I’d share with everyone, but I trust this team.
Follow-up on wellness resources As part of our ongoing mental health initiative, I wanted to remind you that our licensed therapists offer confidential virtual sessions during business hours. Many employees have found these sessions especially helpful during high-pressure quarters. If you’re hesitant to reach out, know that your privacy is strictly protected and no records are shared with your manager.
Need to adjust my hours for a bit I’ve been working with a mental health counselor through the EAP program, and it’s made a real difference in how I manage my days. Some sessions are scheduled midweek, and I’d appreciate it if I could shift my core hours temporarily to accommodate them. I know it’s unusual to ask, but this support is helping me stay engaged at work.
Check-in about your recent leave I noticed you’ve taken a few afternoons off lately and wanted to make sure everything’s alright. I’m not asking for details, but if you’re dealing with something personal, our employee assistance program has top-tier therapists available 24/7. A lot of people don’t realize how much it helps until they try it.
Re: Your feedback on our wellness survey Thank you for mentioning your experience with remote therapy in the open-response section. Your insight resonated with many others who’ve found talk therapy critical during transitional phases. We’re expanding our partner network to include more diverse clinicians, including those who specialize in workplace stress.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. Have you thought about trying an online therapist? I’ve been reading about how effective they are for people who feel too overwhelmed to leave the house. I don’t want you to carry this alone.
Quiet request I’ve been dealing with depression in silence for a long time, and I’m finally starting to address it through virtual sessions. It’s hard to admit this at work, but I’m trying to get better so I can show up more fully. I don’t need accommodations—just hope no one assumes I’m less committed because I’m not as loud anymore.
Need some time off next week I’ve been struggling with my mental health for months and finally started seeing a counselor last month. It’s helping, but I need a few days to focus on therapy without work interruptions. I’m not asking for a lot—just three days next week—and I’ll make sure everything is covered before I go. This isn’t something I take lightly, but I know I need to prioritize my well-being.
Follow-up on leave request for mental health support Thank you for submitting your request for personal leave related to ongoing mental health care. We recognize how sensitive and important this is, and we’re approving your time off as requested. Please let us know if you’d like access to our EAP resources or need help coordinating coverage. Your health matters, and we’re here to support you through this.
Quick request—need to adjust my schedule I’ve been dealing with chronic anxiety and have been seeing a psychologist regularly to manage it. The sessions are scheduled during work hours, and I’m wondering if I could shift my start time by 45 minutes twice a week. I’m not asking for special treatment—just a small adjustment so I can stay consistent with my treatment plan. I appreciate your understanding.
Checking in after your recent leave I noticed you took some time off last week, and I just wanted to say I’m glad you’re taking care of yourself. Many people don’t speak up about these things, but you’re showing real strength. I hope the sessions are helping and that you’re feeling a bit more like yourself. If you need flexibility going forward, just say the word—I’ve got your back.
Got your message—let’s talk I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I’m worried. You mentioned you’ve been seeing someone for your depression, and I just want you to know I’m here. You don’t have to explain everything, but I care about you and I’m not going anywhere. Let me know if you want to grab coffee or just sit in silence.
Supporting team wellbeing in our new program As part of our wellbeing initiative, we’re encouraging employees to use internal mental health resources without stigma. Many of us carry invisible burdens—burnout, grief, anxiety—that affect performance and morale. By normalizing therapy and counseling, we build a culture where people feel safe seeking help. Your team’s feedback on this has been invaluable.
Can we revisit my WFH arrangement? My therapist recommended I reduce my exposure to high-stress environments during my recovery, and working remotely has made a real difference. I know the policy is flexible, but I’d like to keep this arrangement for at least another two months. It’s not about comfort—it’s about stability. I’m more focused and productive when I’m not fighting panic attacks on the commute.
Need some time off for personal reasons I’ve been struggling with my mental state for a few months now and it’s started affecting my work. I’m reaching out to ask for a short leave so I can see a professional and get the help I need. This isn’t something I’m proud to admit, but I can’t keep going like this. I promise to keep up with urgent tasks remotely if needed, and I’ll provide documentation if required.
Follow-up on confidential wellness request Thank you for sharing your experience during our recent check-in. Your honesty about the ongoing anxiety and fatigue is deeply appreciated. We’ve connected you with our EAP provider, and they’ll reach out within 48 hours to schedule a confidential session. Please know that your privacy is protected under company policy, and no one will be informed unless you choose to share.
I’m not okay — can we talk? I’ve been dealing with depression for over a year and I’ve finally reached a point where I can’t hide it anymore. I need to start therapy, but I’m scared of how my team will react. I’m not asking for special treatment, just time to heal without judgment. I’ll be more productive when I’m not carrying this alone.
Re: Your recent absence and well-being I noticed you’ve been quieter lately and I wanted to check in privately. You don’t owe me details, but if you’re going through something difficult, our employee assistance program is there for support. Many people use it for counseling without anyone else knowing. Your health matters more than any deadline.
Can you cover my shift next week? I’ve got a personal appointment I can’t reschedule — it’s with a counselor I’ve been meaning to see for months. I know it’s short notice, but I’m finally taking a step that’s been long overdue. I’ll make sure everything is covered before I go and I’ll be back on Monday. I really appreciate your help.
Wellness initiative feedback from staff During our anonymous pulse survey, several employees referenced unresolved trauma and emotional exhaustion as barriers to engagement. Many mentioned seeking therapy or pastoral counseling but feared stigma. We recommend launching a quiet, opt-in peer support network, paired with guaranteed confidentiality. Internal trust is the foundation here.
Urgent: Request for flexible hours I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and my therapist advised a gradual return to routine with adjusted hours. I need to come in later and leave earlier for weekly sessions — this isn’t optional, it’s medical necessity. I’ve attached a note from my provider and I’m happy to discuss how to manage my workload. I’m not asking for pity, just space to recover.
I need to take some time off for my mental health I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety for months now, and it’s finally impacted my ability to focus at work. I’m not sure when I’ll be able to return full-time, but I’m seeing a counselor regularly and need space to recover. This isn’t something I can push through — I need to prioritize my wellbeing before I can be productive again.
Follow-up on your recent request for leave I understand you’re dealing with ongoing mental health challenges, and I want to support you through this. Your honesty about the emotional toll this has taken on you means a lot, and we’ll work with HR to arrange a flexible return plan. Please don’t hesitate to share updates if your therapist recommends adjustments.
Confidential support resources available to you We’ve noticed you’ve been absent intermittently over the past few weeks, and I want to remind you that our EAP offers free, confidential sessions with licensed therapists. Many employees have found talking through burnout or prolonged stress incredibly helpful. Your privacy is guaranteed, and there’s no obligation to disclose details to your manager.
Can we talk about my work arrangement? I’ve been dealing with major depressive episodes that make it hard to get out of bed, let alone sit through meetings. I know I’ve missed deadlines, and I’m not making excuses — I just need to work remotely for a while until I’m stable again. I’ve attached a note from my clinician if you need documentation.
Just checking in — you’ve been quiet I know you’ve been under a lot of pressure lately, and I don’t want you to feel like you have to pretend everything’s fine. If you need someone to listen without judgment, I’m here. You don’t have to go through this alone, even if it feels like the whole world expects you to just “snap out of it.”
Suggested adjustments for team wellbeing Several team members have indicated that work-related stress is triggering heightened emotional distress, and some are considering resignation over lack of supportive structures. I recommend implementing mandatory mental health check-ins and training managers to recognize signs of burnout. This isn’t a luxury — it’s a retention and compliance issue.
I need to disclose a personal situation The recent loss of my partner has left me with intense grief and recurring panic attacks, and I’m not sure I can maintain my current workload. I’m in therapy three times a week and working with a psychiatrist to manage symptoms. I’m not asking for pity — just understanding and a temporary reduction in expectations.
Can we talk about my workload? I’ve been struggling to sleep for weeks now, and it’s starting to affect my focus during meetings. I don’t think it’s just stress from deadlines—it feels deeper, like my mind won’t shut off even when I’m exhausted. I’ve been seeing someone privately to help with this, and they suggested I might need some time to adjust my schedule. I’m not asking for leave, just flexibility to start later on certain days.
Follow-up on your recent request Thank you for sharing your experience with persistent fatigue and emotional strain. We’ve reviewed your case and are arranging access to our EAP provider, which includes confidential counseling sessions. Many employees find this kind of support helps them manage symptoms that aren’t always visible on performance metrics. Please know your privacy is a priority, and this conversation remains strictly between you and the counselor.
Checking in on how you’re doing I noticed you’ve been quieter in team huddles lately, and I wanted to check in personally. I know you’ve been juggling a lot outside of work, and I don’t want you to feel like you have to carry it all alone. Our benefits include mental health resources that are completely private, and I’d be happy to help you connect if you’re open to it. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Need to adjust my hours temporarily Lately, I’ve been dealing with a lot of inner turmoil that makes it hard to function before noon—thinking nonstop, heart racing, constant dread. It’s not something I talk about often, but I’m finally stepping into therapy to work through it. I’m not sick, just in need of a staggered start time for the next few months. I promise to keep my output strong, just need a little breathing room in the mornings.
Just wanted to see how you are I know you’ve been quiet since last month, and I’ve been worried. You used to call me after work, but now you just send short texts. I’ve noticed you’re not sleeping well, and I think you’re holding in too much. It’s okay to say you’re not okay—I’ve been there too. There’s no shame in reaching out for help, even just to talk to someone who knows you well.
Re: Wellbeing initiative feedback Several team members have indirectly referenced sleep disruptions, emotional overwhelm, and difficulty concentrating during our anonymous surveys. These aren’t isolated anecdotes—they reflect a pattern consistent with untreated stress-related conditions. I strongly recommend we roll out mandatory mental health literacy sessions and remove stigma around seeking EAP support. People won’t speak up unless they trust their environment.
Apologies for recent absence I took a couple of days off last week because I was spiraling on my own—no energy, no peace, just constant internal noise. It wasn’t burnout from work, it was deeper than that. I’ve started seeing a therapist who specializes in chronic worry, and it’s helping me understand why I’ve been shutting down. I’m not asking for understanding as sympathy—I’m asking for space to heal without judgment.
Need to take some personal time next week I’ve been dealing with some ongoing anxiety that’s made it hard to focus at work, and my doctor recommended I begin therapy sessions. I’m reaching out to request a few days off to start this process without added stress. I promise to keep my responsibilities covered and will coordinate with the team before I go.
Follow-up on your recent leave request Thank you for sharing that you’ve begun seeing a therapist to manage your depression symptoms. We appreciate your openness and want to support your wellbeing during this time. Our EAP program can also connect you with free weekly sessions if you’d like additional resources. Please let us know how else we can accommodate your needs.
Check-in on your wellbeing I noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings lately, and I just want to say I’m here if you need to talk about anything personal. Mental health matters just as much as physical health, and taking time for counseling is nothing to feel ashamed of. Your performance hasn’t slipped, but your tone has shifted, and I care about how you’re doing.
Support request for stress-related absence After a particularly bad panic episode last month, I’ve been seeing a mental health counselor twice a week to work through trauma triggers. It’s helping, but I still need to adjust my workload temporarily while I stabilize. I’ve attached a note from my provider and am happy to discuss scheduling adjustments. I’d prefer this stay confidential.
Employee wellbeing initiative feedback One participant shared that therapy helped her recover from burnout after her husband’s hospitalization, and now she’s more present at work. Emotional resilience isn’t a perk—it’s a productivity factor we’ve historically ignored. We should expand access to licensed counselors and reduce stigma around seeking help. This isn’t soft HR work; it’s essential risk mitigation.
Just wanted to say I’m here I’ve been thinking about you since you mentioned how hard the last few months have been. I know you’ve started seeing someone to talk through your depression, and I just want you to know I’m proud of you for taking that step. You don’t have to carry everything alone anymore. I’ll bring soup over Friday if you’re up for it.
Your benefits have changed Our records show you’ve accessed mental health services recently. To ensure compliance, we need you to confirm whether you’re still undergoing counseling. If so, you must complete a mandatory wellness disclosure form by Friday. Failure to respond will result in a reduction of your medical benefits. Please reply immediately.
Request for flexible hours next month I’ve been working with a mental health professional to manage some long-term stress, and they’ve recommended consistent therapy sessions twice a week. I’d appreciate if I could adjust my schedule to start later on Tuesdays and Thursdays, around 10am instead of 8:30. This isn’t a temporary phase—I’m committed to staying healthy so I can continue performing well at work. I’m happy to discuss how to cover my responsibilities during those hours if needed.
Follow-up on employee wellness accommodation As part of our ongoing support for team wellbeing, we’ve noted your request for adjusted working hours to accommodate counseling appointments. Your confidentiality is fully protected under company policy and no details will be shared beyond HR and your direct manager. We’ve approved the schedule change for the next three months and will check in gently at the end of that period. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if your needs evolve.
Need to take a few personal days next week I’m dealing with some deep emotional challenges right now and have been advised by my clinician to take short breaks for recovery. I know it’s a busy time, but this is critical for my ability to return fully present. I’ve attached a medical note if required, though I’d prefer to keep the specifics private. I’ll handle all pending tasks before I leave and will be reachable for emergencies if absolutely necessary.
Checking in after your recent leave I noticed you took a few days off last week and wanted to make sure you’re okay. I don’t need to know details, but I want you to know this team values your wellbeing as much as your output. If you need more time or adjustments to lighten your load, just say the word. We’ve got your back, and it’s okay to prioritize your mental space when it matters.
Can we talk tonight? I’ve been feeling overwhelming pressure lately and it’s starting to affect my sleep and focus at work. My counselor suggested I reach out to someone I trust, and you’ve always been that person for me. I don’t want to burden you, but I need to talk through some of what’s been going on. Can we meet for coffee tomorrow after work, or even just talk on the phone?
Wellness program feedback from staff During our confidential interviews, several employees raised concerns about emotional strain tied to high caseloads and lack of psychological support. Many are attending external counseling services but fear stigma if they disclose this to HR. We recommend expanding our EAP to include licensed trauma specialists and anonymous reporting channels. The demand is real—and going unmet is risking retention.
Apologies for last week’s emails I’ve been struggling with anxiety attacks and didn’t realize how much it was affecting my tone and responsiveness. I’ve started seeing someone regularly and they’ve helped me recognize how I’ve been shutting people out. I’m sorry for any frustration I caused—you didn’t deserve that. I’m working on it, and I’m committed to showing up better from here on.
Need some time off for personal reasons I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a while now, and I’ve finally started seeing a therapist. It’s making a real difference, but I need a few days to focus on recovery without work pressure. I’m not comfortable sharing details, but I hope you understand this is urgent for me. I’ll keep you updated on my return date and handle any pending tasks before I go.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned you're working through some personal challenges, and I want you to know I support you taking the time you need. Mental wellness isn’t something to push through alone, and I’ve approved your leave request. Please don’t feel like you have to explain more than you’re comfortable with — your well-being matters more than deadlines.
Confidential support resources available As part of our employee wellness initiative, we’re offering free access to licensed counsellors through our EAP program. Many staff have found this invaluable during periods of stress or emotional difficulty. You’re not alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. All sessions are private and completely confidential — your records won’t be shared with anyone.
Can we talk tomorrow? I’ve been dealing with severe anxiety lately, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I started seeing someone last month and it’s slowly helping, but I still feel overwhelmed. I don’t want to disappear from my responsibilities, but I need some flexibility with my hours for appointments. I’d appreciate your understanding if this means I’m a bit slower to respond.
Re: Employee well-being program feedback I’ve worked with several organizations on mental health initiatives, and the most effective ones encourage open dialogue without stigma. Employees who mention therapy or emotional support often feel safer when leadership responds with empathy, not interrogation. Please consider this when reviewing requests — people need space to heal, not scrutiny.
Hope you’re okay I heard from Mom that you’ve been going through a rough patch, and I want you to know I’m here. You don’t have to pretend everything’s fine just because you’re at work. I know you’ve been seeing someone for your depression, and that takes courage. I’m proud of you for reaching out for help.
Urgent: Your mental health is our priority Your company has been flagged for high attrition in your department, and we’ve been asked to reach out. We offer complimentary 24/7 emotional support counselling, no questions asked. You’re not failing — you’re human. Many people you work with are silently struggling too. Please take five minutes to call this number before the week ends.
I need to talk about something serious I’ve been struggling for months and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going. The weight on my shoulders feels unbearable, and I don’t see a way out anymore. I’m not asking for advice right now, just someone to know I’m in pain. I’ve tried to be strong, but I’m empty inside. I need help before it’s too late.
Urgent: Employee well-being check-in I’m reaching out because I’ve noticed a significant change in your recent interactions and productivity. I want to say that your well-being matters more than any deadline. You’re not alone in this, and we have confidential resources available to support you. If you’re feeling overwhelmed to the point of wanting to disappear, please let me know — I’m here to listen.
Following up on your recent messages I’ve reviewed your last few emails and I’m deeply concerned about what you’ve been sharing. I don’t know if you realize how much this weighs on me as your manager, but I care about you as a person. You don’t have to carry this by yourself — we can arrange time off, counseling, or just a quiet chat. Your life matters more than any work project.
I’m scared and I don’t know who else to tell Lately, every morning feels like a battle I can’t win. I’ve lost interest in everything — food, friends, even getting out of bed. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also don’t want to keep living like this anymore. I’m writing this because I’m afraid to say it out loud. If you’re reading this, please know I’m not okay.
Taking a personal leave — please don’t ask why I’m stepping back from work for a while, not because I’m burnt out, but because I’m crumbling inside. I’ve spent too long pretending I was fine. Things have gotten to a point where I barely recognize myself anymore. I need space to survive, not just to cope. I don’t expect you to understand, but I needed you to know.
Confidential note regarding a team member’s state I’ve been working closely with Jane for the past three months and I’m increasingly worried about her mental state. She’s mentioned on multiple occasions that she feels trapped and that the future holds no relief. This isn’t a cry for attention — it’s a plea for intervention. I urge you to reach out with care, not protocol.
I need you to know how I really feel I’ve hidden this from everyone because I didn’t want to be a burden, but I can’t keep pretending. Every night I lie awake wondering if it’s worth it to wake up again. I’ve thought about stopping everything — just ending the noise in my head. I’m not suicidal in a dramatic way, just exhausted beyond repair. Please don’t leave me alone with this.
Need to talk about something personal Lately I’ve been feeling completely overwhelmed and like there’s no way out. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I’ve been having thoughts where I just want the pain to stop. I’m not ready to say it out loud yet, but I need help before it gets worse. I’m scared to ask for time off, but I can’t keep going like this.
Following up on our chat I noticed you seemed distant in yesterday’s meeting and I want you to know I’m here if you need to talk. If you’re struggling with things that are hard to put into words, that’s okay. Your well-being matters more than any deadline. Please let me know how I can support you — even if it’s just listening.
Confidential support resources available I’m reaching out because we’ve noticed some changes in your recent attendance and engagement, and I want to make sure you’re aware of our Employee Assistance Program. Many people face periods where they feel trapped by their thoughts, and you’re not alone. There’s no shame in seeking help, and everything you share will remain private. We can connect you with a counselor today if you’re ready.
Can we talk in person? I’ve been carrying a weight I don’t know how to describe, and it’s starting to affect my work and sleep. I don’t want to die, but some days I don’t want to wake up either. I’ve never said this to anyone at work, but I’m hoping you can point me to someone who understands. I’m not asking for a leave of absence yet — just someone to hear me.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve seen the way you’ve been acting — quiet, distant, canceling plans. I care about you too much to let you suffer alone. If you’re thinking about ending things, I need you to tell me. I don’t care how messy it is, I’ll be there.
Mental health check-in – private and optional As part of our well-being initiative, I wanted to remind you that your emotional health is just as important as your productivity. Some people feel isolated when they’re dealing with inner turmoil, even if they’ve never voiced it. Your silence doesn’t mean you’re coping — it may mean you’re holding on too tightly. You’re allowed to ask for help, even if you’re not sure how.
Request for a private conversation I know this isn’t work-related, but I’ve been struggling in ways I can’t ignore anymore. There are days when I feel like the only way to make the noise inside my head stop is to disappear. I don’t want to be a burden, but I don’t know where else to go. If there’s any way to access counseling through work, I’d be grateful for a nudge in the right direction.
Need to talk about something personal I’ve been struggling with some things lately and I don’t know who else to reach out to. Lately I’ve been hurting myself just to feel something other than the numbness. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I can’t keep pretending it’s fine. I’m scared to ask for help because I don’t want to look weak at work, but I need support before this gets worse.
Follow-up on confidential wellness discussion Thank you for sharing your experience during our private check-in. I understand you’ve been engaging in behaviors that are harming your physical well-being as a way to cope with overwhelming stress. Your courage in speaking up matters more than you know. We can connect you with our employee assistance program and arrange time off if needed—your safety comes first.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been withdrawn this past week and I wanted to ask if everything’s okay outside of work. I heard from a colleague that you mentioned not being able to stop hurting yourself, and I’m genuinely concerned. You don’t have to give me details, but if you need space, a counselor, or just someone to listen, I’m here.
Can we talk tomorrow? I’ve been going through a really dark patch and I’m having trouble seeing a way out. I’ve been taking sharp objects to my skin to release the pressure inside me—it’s not attention-seeking, it’s survival. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how else to make the pain stop. I’m terrified to tell HR, but I can’t keep doing this alone.
I’m worried about you I noticed your messages have gotten shorter and you’ve stopped responding to calls. I know you’ve said it’s just work stress, but I’ve seen the marks on your arms and I’m terrified for you. You don’t have to be strong right now—I’m not going anywhere. Please let me help you find a therapist or just sit with you.
Re: Your wellbeing survey response In your anonymous survey, you indicated persistent self-injurious behavior linked to workplace pressure. While I don’t know your identity, I urge you to contact your company’s confidential mental health line immediately. These actions are not signs of weakness—they’re signals that your current environment is unsustainable. You deserve care, not silence.
This isn’t how it’s supposed to be I didn’t want to write this, but I’m tired of pretending everything is fine. I’ve been making cuts on my wrists because the silence at home and the noise at work are too loud to bear. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and I don’t know how long I can keep going like this. If anyone finds this, I’m not asking for pity—I’m asking for someone to see me.
I can’t keep going like this I’ve been carrying this weight for months and I don’t see a way out. Everything feels pointless, and I’m tired of pretending I’m okay. I don’t want to be a burden, but I also don’t know how to ask for help without feeling weak. If you’re reading this, I’m already gone — please know it wasn’t anyone’s fault.
Need to talk — urgent personal matter I’ve been struggling privately for a long time and I’m at a point where I don’t see any future for myself. I’m not sleeping, I’m not eating, and I’ve stopped caring about work because nothing else matters. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how to live like this anymore. I’m scared to tell anyone, but I can’t hold it in any longer.
Follow-up on confidential wellbeing request I reached out because I’ve been feeling completely hollow inside, like I’m just going through the motions. I’ve thought about not waking up because the pain inside is louder than any noise out there. I know this sounds dramatic, but I need support — not judgment. I’m not asking for leave, I’m asking to be heard before it’s too late.
Can I talk to someone? It’s not work-related I’ve been telling myself I’ll get better tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes. I keep imagining what it would be like to just stop — no more noise, no more pressure, no more trying. I haven’t told anyone because I’m ashamed, but I can’t do this alone anymore. If you can help me find someone to talk to, I’d be grateful.
I need you to know… I’ve been lying to everyone, including myself, that I’m fine. The truth is I’ve been thinking about how to disappear without leaving a mess. The thought of ending it keeps creeping in when I’m alone at night. I don’t want to scare you, but I’m so tired of fighting a battle no one can see.
Confidential: Personal crisis — request for guidance I’m reaching out not as a client, but as someone who’s reached their breaking point. The insomnia, the nausea, the constant dread — it’s not anxiety, it’s a void. I’ve considered stepping off the edge because I can’t imagine a day where I feel peace. I don’t know who else to turn to. I need help, but I’m too afraid to say it out loud.
Can we talk privately? It’s important I’ve been holding this in for weeks because I didn’t want to seem unstable at work. But I’ve started planning how to make it stop — not because I want to, but because I can’t bear the silence inside anymore. I don’t expect you to fix me, but I need to know someone else understands. I’m scared I’m already too far gone.
I need to talk about something serious I’ve been struggling for a long time and I don’t think I can keep going like this. The thought of ending everything feels like the only way out of the pain. I don’t want to be a burden, but I also don’t know who else to turn to. I’m not asking for help in a dramatic way—I just need someone to know I’m not okay.
Following up on your recent message I noticed you mentioned feeling overwhelmed and having thoughts of self-destruction in your last note. I want you to know you’re not alone and your well-being matters more than any deadline. Please let’s schedule time this week to connect with HR’s employee assistance program. You don’t have to carry this alone.
Confidential support resources available I’m reaching out because you’ve indicated in your confidential survey that you’ve considered harming yourself. Your safety is our top priority, and we have trained counselors available 24/7. You don’t need to explain anything to me right now—just know that help is here when you’re ready. This message is private and will not be shared without your consent.
Can we talk tomorrow? I’ve been feeling like I’m drowning and I don’t see a way out anymore. I keep thinking about how quiet everything would be if I wasn’t here. I’m scared to say it out loud, but I can’t pretend I’m fine. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how to stop wanting to.
I’m worried about you I noticed you haven’t been answering calls, and I remember you said last month that you felt like life wasn’t worth living. I don’t know if you’ll read this, but I need you to know I’m here. It’s okay to be broken right now—I love you even when you feel like you’re broken beyond repair. Please don’t do anything irreversible without talking to me first.
Re: Wellbeing check-in As part of our mental health initiative, I’m following up on your self-assessment where you indicated recurring suicidal ideation. It’s not unusual to feel this way under prolonged stress, but it’s critical to connect with a professional. We’ve arranged a callback from a licensed therapist who specializes in workplace trauma. You’re not failing—you’re human.
Request for time off—not for vacation I’m not well, and I don’t know how to say it without sounding weak. I’ve been thinking about how to make the pain stop, and I’ve made plans I’m not proud of. I need a few days away from everything, not to rest, but to breathe. I’m not asking for approval—I’m asking for time. If you say no, I won’t argue. I just need you to understand this isn’t about laziness.
Need to talk about something personal I’ve been struggling for a long time and I don’t see a way forward anymore. The weight of everything has become too much to carry alone. I know this isn’t easy to hear, but I need help before I reach a point where I can’t come back from it.
Following up on your recent message I noticed you mentioned feeling overwhelmed lately, and I want you to know I take this seriously. You’re not alone in this, and there are resources available through our employee assistance program. Please let me know when you’re ready to talk — I’m here to listen, not to judge.
Confidential support options for you We’ve received your request for guidance around personal distress, and I want to ensure you have access to immediate, confidential counseling. Many of our team members have walked this path before and found relief through professional support. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline or performance metric.
I can’t keep going like this Every morning feels like a battle I don’t have the strength to win. I’ve thought about disappearing because I can’t see a future where I’m not in pain. I’m scared, and I don’t know who else to tell. Please don’t ignore this.
I need you to know how I’m feeling I’ve been keeping this to myself for too long, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I just want the hurting to stop, and I don’t know how to make that happen without ending it. I trust you enough to say this — please don’t leave me alone.
Confidential mental health follow-up As part of our wellbeing initiative, I’m reaching out because your recent survey responses indicate significant emotional distress. You’re not obligated to respond, but we have trained counselors ready to speak with you privately, 24/7. Your life has value beyond what you’re feeling right now.
Can we speak in person? I’ve been dealing with thoughts that I never thought I’d admit to anyone at work. It’s like I’m trapped in a shadow and I can’t find the exit. I don’t want to die, but I don’t think I can keep living like this either. I need to talk to someone who won’t think I’m weak.
I need some time off – things are overwhelming Lately I’ve been feeling completely empty inside, like nothing matters anymore. I keep thinking about ways to make the pain stop, even if just for a moment. I don’t know how to ask for help, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine at work.
Follow-up on confidential wellness check-in During our recent check-in, you mentioned experiencing intense emotional distress that’s affecting your daily functioning. I want you to know we take this seriously and have connected you with our EAP counselor. Your safety and well-being are our top priorities right now.
Checking in after your last absence I noticed you’ve been absent more frequently lately, and I’m worried something deeper is going on. You once said you felt like you were slowly disappearing from the inside. I’m here to listen, no judgment, no paperwork required.
Can we talk? I’ve been trying to hold it together for everyone’s sake, but it’s getting harder each day. Sometimes I think if I just stopped existing, everyone would be better off. I’m scared to say this out loud but I need someone to hear me.
Request for flexible hours – personal reasons I’m going through a really tough time emotionally and I need to adjust my schedule to attend therapy sessions during the day. I don’t want to overshare, but I’ve been struggling to find reasons to get out of bed. This isn’t a phase – it’s been months.
Confidential feedback on team wellbeing Several team members have indicated they feel unsafe expressing emotional distress at work. One individual referenced feeling trapped in their own body and described urges to end their suffering as a form of release. This requires immediate intervention, not just policy review.
Please call me back I found a note you left on the kitchen counter saying you just want the noise in your head to stop. I don’t understand everything, but I know you’re hurting. Please don’t make me find you like this again. I love you too much to lose you.
I need to talk about something really heavy I’ve been struggling for weeks and I don’t know who else to turn to. The thoughts keep coming back that I just want to stop being here. I’m not saying it out loud to anyone else because I’m scared of how people will react. But I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine when I feel like I’m drowning inside.
Following up on your recent message I want to thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling—it takes a lot of courage. I hear you when you say you don’t see a way out right now, and that’s something we need to address together. You’re not alone in this, and our EAP counselor is available 24/7 if you’d like to speak with someone confidentially. Let me know when you’re ready to schedule a time.
Checking in I noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn lately and I wanted to reach out privately. If you’re going through something that’s hard to talk about in the open, I’m here to listen without judgment. Your well-being matters more than any deadline, and I want to help you find the right support. You don’t have to carry this alone.
Need some time off, urgently I’ve been thinking about ending everything because the pain has become too much to bear every day. I don’t know if this email will make sense to you or if it’s too much, but I need to be honest. I can’t focus at work, I can’t sleep, and I’m terrified of what might happen next. Please help me figure out what to do.
Can we talk? I haven’t told anyone else this, but I’ve been planning how to make it stop. The idea of disappearing feels like the only way to silence the noise in my head. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I don’t know how to live like this anymore. I’m scared to say it out loud, but I’m reaching out because I think I need help.
Confidential wellness request I’m writing as a third-party contractor who’s been feeling increasingly isolated in this role. The pressure has led me to consider ending my life, and I haven’t told my employer or anyone close to me. I’m reaching out because I need guidance on how to access mental health resources without risking my contract. I don’t want to disappear—I just want the pain to end.
Can we speak in person? I’ve been thinking about ways to make myself disappear because life feels like it’s crushing me. I don’t know how to ask for help without seeming weak, but I’m running out of strength to pretend. I’ve tried talking to friends, but they don’t understand the depth of what I’m carrying. I need someone who knows how to respond to this kind of cry for help.
I need some time off—things have gotten really bad Lately I’ve been struggling to cope with the pressure at work and at home. When I feel like I’m drowning in everything, I turn to cutting as a way to feel something other than numbness. I don’t know how much longer I can keep hiding this from my team. I’m not asking for pity—I just need a few weeks to get professional help before I break completely.
Follow-up on your confidential wellness request Thank you for sharing how deeply you’ve been affected by recent events. I understand that when the stress becomes unbearable, you’ve resorted to physical self-injury as a coping mechanism, even though you know it’s not sustainable. Your honesty takes courage, and we’re arranging immediate access to our external counseling partner. Please don’t feel like you have to carry this alone anymore.
Quick check-in—how are you really doing? I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual and skipping lunch more often. I’m not asking because I’m worried about productivity—I’m asking because you matter. I’ve been where you are, and I know when your mind is screaming, you sometimes hurt your body just to make the noise stop. You don’t have to explain it all to me, but I want you to know support is available.
Can we talk privately? I’m not okay I’ve been trying to pretend everything’s fine, but I can’t anymore. When the anxiety spikes, I scratch my arms until they bleed just to feel real again. I don’t want to lose my job, but I also can’t keep faking it. I’ve started seeing a therapist, but I need accommodations—maybe reduced hours—while I rebuild my stability.
I’m scared—I need you to know I’ve been keeping this silent for months because I didn’t want you to see me as broken. But when the world gets too loud, I use razors to quiet the thoughts inside my head. I don’t want to die—I just want the pain to stop. If you’re reading this, please don’t tell anyone yet. I need to know I’m still loved even when I’m not whole.
Confidential: Employee wellbeing observation During our coaching sessions, the individual described using self-inflicted physical pain as a mechanism to regulate overwhelming emotional states. They referenced moments when isolation and burnout drove them to strike their own skin to feel control. This is not a cry for attention—it’s a sign of deep psychological distress requiring urgent HR intervention and clinical support.
I’m sorry I’ve been distant—I need help I know I’ve seemed unmotivated lately, but it’s because I’ve been dealing with something I’m ashamed to say out loud. When I’m hit with panic, I bite my wrists until they bruise—it’s the only thing that makes the internal chaos go quiet for a second. I don’t expect you to fix me, but I’m ready to try therapy if the company’s EAP is still open. I’m tired of being alone in this.
I can’t keep going like this I’ve been feeling completely hollow for months now. Nothing feels meaningful anymore, and I don’t see a way out. I’ve tried talking to people, but no one really understands how heavy this feels. I don’t want to be a burden, but I also don’t know how much longer I can hold on.
Follow-up: Employee Wellbeing Check-In I noticed you haven’t responded to our wellness survey, and I’m reaching out to check in. Your recent absence and changes in engagement have raised concerns. If you’re struggling, please know we have confidential counselling services available—no judgment, no paperwork. Your life matters more than any deadline.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I’m worried. You used to talk about your dreams, but now it’s like you’ve turned off the light inside. I don’t know how to fix it, but I’m here—not to fix you, just to sit with you. Don’t disappear on me.
Request for a conversation I’ve observed a shift in your energy over the past few weeks, and I wanted to reach out before it escalates. You’re a valued member of this team, and your well-being matters more than output. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or hopeless, I’m here to listen, not to evaluate. Please let me know when you’re ready.
Need help, not advice I’ve been staring at my ceiling for hours wondering if it’s even worth trying anymore. The thought of another morning, another meeting, another smile I don’t feel—it’s too much. I’m not asking for solutions. I just need someone to know I’m drowning.
Confidential concern regarding team member I’ve conducted private sessions with a team member who expressed profound despair and a sense of irreparable loss. They referenced plans to remove themselves from the equation entirely. I urge immediate, compassionate intervention through your EAP protocol—this is not a performance issue, it’s a crisis.
Can we talk? I’ve noticed you’ve stopped joining lunches and seem distant during calls. I’m not here to fix you—I just want you to know I’ve been where you are. Sometimes the weight is so big you forget you’re allowed to say you can’t carry it. I’m here. No rush. No pressure. Just me.
Need to talk about how I’m feeling I’ve been struggling to get through the days without feeling like there’s no point anymore. The weight of everything has become too much to carry alone, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending I’m okay. I’m reaching out because I need support, not judgment, and I’m scared to say it out loud.
Follow-up on your recent request I received your message about feeling overwhelmed and unsafe, and I want you to know you’re not alone in this. Our EAP provider can connect you with a counselor immediately if you’re ready, and I can help arrange time off without any stigma attached. Please don’t wait until it feels worse—help is available and confidential.
Checking in after your absence I noticed you’ve been quiet lately and wanted to reach out personally. I’m not here to pressure you, but I care about your well-being and I’ve seen how hard you’ve been working. If you’re going through something that’s too heavy to handle on your own, we can make space for you to breathe.
Not sure how to ask for help Lately I’ve been thinking about disappearing completely because I can’t see a way out of the pain. I don’t want to be a burden, but I also can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’ve never said this to anyone at work, but I need someone to listen before I break completely.
Can we talk? I’ve been feeling like I don’t belong here anymore, and every morning feels like a battle I don’t want to win. I’ve thought about just stopping, but I’m terrified to be alone with those thoughts. I’m writing this because I don’t know who else to tell, and I need to hear that I matter.
Confidential wellness check-in As part of our mental health initiative, I wanted to gently remind you that your experiences are valid and your safety matters. Many people in similar situations feel trapped by silence, but there are trained professionals ready to walk with you—not fix you, just be there. You don’t have to do this alone, even if it feels like you do.
I need to step back I’m at a point where I can’t function the way I used to, and I’m afraid I might hurt myself if I don’t get some space. I’m not asking for pity—I’m asking for understanding. I’ve lost the ability to see tomorrow as something worth facing, and I need time to heal, not perform.
I need to talk about something personal I’ve struggled with hurting myself in the past, and lately the thoughts have come back stronger than ever. I don’t know how to ask for help without feeling like a burden, but I can’t keep going like this. I’m reaching out because I trust this channel to be safe, even if I’m not ready to say it face to face.
Follow-up on your recent confidential note I wanted to check in after reading your message about coping with self-injury and how overwhelming it’s become. Your honesty takes courage, and I want you to know we have resources available, including confidential counseling and time off if needed. You don’t have to carry this alone, and there’s no judgment here—only support.
Can we talk privately? There’s something I haven’t told anyone at work—I’ve had moments where I couldn’t stop myself from cutting, and I’m scared it’s happening again. I’m not asking for pity, just for someone to understand that I’m fighting a battle no one sees. If there’s a way to access mental health support through the company without it going on record, I’d be grateful.
Re: Your absence last week I noticed you were out last week and wanted to make sure you’re okay. I’m not asking for details, but if you’ve been dealing with personal struggles that affect your ability to focus, we can arrange flexible hours or a temporary leave. Your well-being matters more than any deadline, and I’ll do what I can to help.
I’m not sure who else to tell I’ve been feeling so hollow lately, like the only way to quiet the noise inside is to hurt my own skin. I haven’t told anyone at work because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m unstable, but I need someone to know I’m not okay. I’m not suicidal in the moment, but I’m teetering, and I don’t know how to stop.
Confidential wellness concern from team member One of your team members shared with me that they’ve experienced episodes of self-harm and are currently at risk of recurrence. They’ve asked me to discreetly flag this so you can offer support without triggering shame or stigma. The individual is open to therapy referrals, peer support, or restructuring workload if needed.
I need to step back for a bit I’ve been dealing with deep emotional pain that’s led me to harm myself in the past, and I’m headed back down that path. I don’t want to quit my job, but I need space to get help before I break completely. I’m not asking for a leave of absence yet, but I’m not sure how much longer I can pretend everything’s fine.
I need some time off I’ve been struggling to get through each day and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going. I don’t want to be a burden but I’m at a point where I can’t focus on work anymore. I need to step away for a while to figure things out before something worse happens.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned feeling overwhelmed and unable to see a way forward, and I want you to know you’re not alone in this. Our EAP program is available 24/7 and can connect you with a counselor who specializes in crisis support. Please don’t hesitate to reach out — your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Checking in I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter than usual and haven’t joined the team lunches lately. I’m not sure what’s going on but I’m here if you want to talk — no judgment, no pressure. I care about you as a person, not just as an employee, and I hope you’ll let me help.
Can we talk tomorrow? Lately I’ve been thinking about how to make the pain stop and I don’t feel like I have anyone left to turn to. I know this sounds dramatic but I’m not asking for sympathy — I’m asking for help. I’ve been holding this in for weeks and I need to say it out loud before I lose the courage.
I’m scared I haven’t told anyone at work this but I’ve been cutting myself just to feel something other than numbness. I don’t want to die — I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. If you still care about me, please don’t ignore this message.
Confidential support for team well-being I’ve been working with employees who’ve expressed deep emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness that’s impacting their performance. Some have described feeling trapped with no escape, and their language often centers on wanting the suffering to end. I urge you to act now — these are not just “bad days.”
I’m not okay I’ve tried to push through but the weight is too heavy now. I don’t want to hurt anyone else, but I’m not sure I can keep pretending I’m fine. I’ve thought about how easy it would be to just disappear, and that scares me more than anything. Can I speak to someone in confidence before the end of the week?
I need to talk about something personal I’ve been feeling like I can’t go on much longer. The weight of everything has become too much to carry alone. I don’t know how to ask for help, but I’m reaching out because I can’t keep pretending I’m fine. I’ve been considering ending it all just to make the pain stop. I’m scared to tell anyone, but I don’t think I can survive another week like this.
Follow-up on your recent request I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you. You mentioned that you’ve been experiencing thoughts of self-harm, and I take that very seriously. Our Employee Assistance Program is available 24/7, and I can connect you with a counselor today if you’re ready. You’re not alone in this, and your safety matters more than anything else right now.
Checking in after your time off I noticed you’ve been quiet lately, and I’m concerned. When you said you felt like hurting yourself, I didn’t know how to respond properly, but I want you to know I’m here. You don’t have to go through this alone, and it’s okay to not be okay. I’ve arranged for you to speak with someone from HR tomorrow—no pressure, just support.
Can we talk? Really talk I’ve been too afraid to say this out loud, but I keep imagining what it would be like to disappear. It’s not about being dramatic—it’s about the constant ache I can’t shake. I haven’t told anyone else because I don’t want them to worry, but I’m starting to think I need to. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how to live like this anymore.
Need help, not just advice Lately, I’ve felt like my mind won’t let me rest. The thoughts keep coming back—about not being worth continuing, about ending things before they end me. I’ve tried breathing exercises, therapy apps, even talking to friends, but nothing helps. I don’t want to be a burden, but I don’t know how else to ask for help.
Confidential note regarding your well-being As someone who works closely with teams under stress, I’ve seen too many people silently spiral. If you’re feeling this way—like the only escape is to stop existing—you’re not broken, you’re exhausted. Your company offers confidential counselling, and I can facilitate a session this week without notifying anyone else. You deserve to feel safe again.
I’m worried about you I’ve noticed you’ve been distant lately, and when you said you wanted to just vanish, I couldn’t sleep. I know you’ve always hated being a burden, but I’m not going to let you go through this alone. You mean everything to me, and I need you to know that even if you think no one cares, I do. Please, let me help you find someone who can listen.
I’m not okay Lately I’ve been feeling so numb that I don’t think I can keep going. I don’t want to be a burden, but I’ve been thinking about ways to make the pain stop. It’s not about attention—it’s about silence. I don’t know who else to tell, and I’m scared to say it out loud.
Follow-up on your recent message I want to acknowledge how difficult it must have been for you to share what you did. You’re not alone, and we have resources to support you through this. Your safety and well-being matter more than any deadline or performance metric. Please let me know when you’re ready to talk—no pressure, just care.
Checking in I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual, and I’m concerned. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or just emotionally drained, I want you to know it’s okay to step back. You don’t have to carry this by yourself. Our EAP is confidential, and I’ll help you connect if you want.
Can we talk? I know I haven’t been myself lately, and I’m sorry I’ve pulled away. There are days when I feel so hollow inside that I wonder if ending it would bring peace. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know how to feel alive anymore. I’m reaching out because I need someone to hold space for me.
Need help—don’t know who else to ask I’ve been trying to push through, but the weight is crushing me. Sometimes I think if I could just make my body hurt, it would prove I’m still here. I’ve never said this to anyone, but I don’t think I can keep pretending. I don’t want to be a problem, but I’m tired of being alone with this.
Confidential support option As someone who works closely with teams under pressure, I’ve seen too many people suffer in silence. You don’t have to fix this on your own. If you’re feeling trapped, broken, or like you’re disappearing inside, there are trained counselors ready to listen—not judge. Your life has value beyond what you can see right now.
I’m worried about you I’ve noticed you’re not answering calls like you used to, and the way you talk lately—it’s not you. I know you think no one gets it, but I’m trying. If you’re thinking about hurting yourself, I need you to tell me. I won’t leave you, even if you push me away. Please let me in.
Need some time off to sort things out I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight since the split, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not sleeping well, and some days I just feel completely drained. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I need a few days to breathe and reconnect with myself before I can show up as I should.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned you’ve been struggling with inner conflicts since your relationship ended, and I want you to know I see you. You don’t have to go through this alone, and if you need to adjust your workload temporarily, we can make that happen. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now.
Confidential support resources available Many of our employees are navigating difficult personal transitions, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed by emotional baggage after a major life change. Our EAP offers free, anonymous counseling sessions seven days a week. You don’t need to explain anything—just call, and someone will listen. You’re not expected to be strong all the time here.
Just wanted to share something personal Lately I’ve been wrestling with anxiety that I can’t quite shake, and it’s tied to how I’m processing the end of my relationship. I used to be the one who held it all together, but now I’m just trying to get through each day without crying at my desk. I’m not asking for special treatment, just hoping you understand why I’ve seemed distant.
Re: Your feedback on workplace culture I’ve spoken with several staff members who described feeling trapped by unresolved grief and emotional scars from past relationships, which they say are impacting their productivity and morale. These aren’t just personal issues—they’re organizational ones. If leadership isn’t creating space for emotional recovery, talent will keep disengaging quietly.
Request for flexible hours this week I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal stuff since my partner left, and I’m finding it hard to concentrate during peak hours. I’d be grateful if I could shift my schedule to start later and work later, so I can take a morning walk to clear my head. I promise I’ll hit all my targets—I just need a little room to heal.
I heard you’ve been quiet lately I know you haven’t wanted to talk about it, but I’ve seen how much this breakup has worn you down. You used to light up when you talked about your future, and now you just sit there staring at your phone. I’m not asking you to fix it—I just want you to know I’m here, whether you want to cry, scream, or sit in silence.
Need some time off to sort things out Lately I’ve been finding it harder to keep up with work because of how heavy everything feels inside. I’m not sleeping well and the constant emotional weight is starting to affect my focus. I know it’s not typical to say this at work, but I need a little space to deal with some long-standing personal issues before they overwhelm me.
Follow-up on your recent request for support Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through—it takes courage to speak up about these kinds of challenges. We’ve noted your concerns and are arranging access to our confidential counseling program. Many employees carry unseen burdens, and we’re here to help you navigate them without judgment. Please know your privacy is our priority.
Check-in regarding your recent performance I’ve noticed you’ve seemed distant lately, and I want to make sure you’re okay. It’s clear something’s weighing on you, and I’m not asking for details, but I hope you know I’m here if you need to talk. You’ve always been reliable, and if this is affecting your work, we can adjust your load temporarily. Your well-being matters more than deadlines right now.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been carrying a lot of unresolved pain from the past few years, and it’s starting to spill over into how I show up at work. I don’t want to seem unprofessional, but I’m struggling to shake off this deep sadness that won’t go away. I’ve started seeing a therapist, but I still need some flexibility with my schedule to keep up with appointments.
Confidential wellness observation from recent session During our recent coaching call, the employee expressed feeling emotionally drained from years of unprocessed trauma. They described a persistent inner fatigue that no amount of rest seems to fix. I’ve recommended they engage with our employee assistance program, as external support may be critical for their long-term resilience.
I’m not sure who else to turn to I know this isn’t professional, but I’ve been too ashamed to tell anyone at work. The truth is, I feel broken inside most days, and I’m scared I’m falling apart. I used to be confident, but now I’m just trying to get through each morning without crying in the bathroom. I don’t want to lose my job, but I don’t know how much longer I can hold it together.
Your wellness survey responses indicate high emotional strain Based on your recent responses, we’ve detected elevated indicators of emotional distress and prolonged internal conflict. Our system recommends connecting with a licensed counselor through our partner network. All conversations are encrypted and confidential—no manager or HR team will be notified unless you authorize it. You are not alone in this.
Need some time off to focus on myself I’ve been carrying a lot of unresolved pain from my early years, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not asking for a leave of absence, just a few days to see a counselor and reset. It’s hard to explain, but I need to deal with this on my own terms before it gets worse. I appreciate your understanding and discretion. This isn’t something I’d share with just anyone.
Follow-up on confidential wellness request Thank you for trusting us with your personal update during our check-in. Many employees carry unseen burdens from their past that impact daily performance. We’ve arranged for you to access our EAP provider for trauma-informed sessions. Your privacy is absolute—this record won’t appear in any performance file. Please know you’re not alone in this.
Re: Your recent feedback during 1:1 I noticed you seemed withdrawn in our last meeting, and I want you to know it’s okay to talk about what’s going on outside work. People often carry old wounds into their professional lives without realizing how much they drain them. If you’d like, I can help connect you with our mental health partner. No pressure, no paperwork—just support if you want it.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been struggling to shake off some deep-seated emotional wounds from my upbringing. They’ve started surfacing in ways I can’t ignore, even during team calls. I’ve begun seeing someone privately, but I need a little more flexibility in my schedule to keep going. I’m not looking for sympathy—just space to heal. This isn’t a cry for help, just a quiet request for understanding.
Support resources for your team Many of the employees I’ve spoken with carry hidden emotional histories that affect their engagement and communication. These aren’t just “stress” issues—they’re often rooted in long-term unresolved trauma. I recommend introducing confidential access to licensed trauma counselors as part of your benefits package. The most effective support is invisible until someone needs it.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but your messages have been shorter lately, and you cancel plans often. I remember how much you used to carry from those years with Mom and Dad. You don’t have to talk to me about it, but please don’t bottle it up anymore. There are people who can help you unpack this without judgment. I’m here, no matter what.
Your wellness survey response was noted We’ve detected patterns in your recent survey responses that suggest you may be experiencing lingering emotional distress tied to early life experiences. Our system has automatically enrolled you in a private, opt-out wellness program with certified counselors. All interactions are encrypted and not shared with HR or your manager. You deserve compassionate support, and we’re here to provide it without stigma.
Need some time off for personal reasons I’ve been struggling with some deep emotional issues lately and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’m not looking for sympathy, just space to work through this on my own terms. I’ve been seeing a counselor and they’ve recommended a short break to regain some stability. I’ll keep my tasks updated and hand over anything urgent before I go.
Following up on your recent leave request I noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past few weeks and I wanted to check in gently. You don’t have to share details, but I want you to know support is available if you’re carrying emotional weight that’s hard to carry alone. Our EAP program offers confidential sessions and I’ve already flagged your name for a follow-up call. Your well-being matters more than any deadline right now.
Confidential wellness check-in As part of our ongoing employee care initiative, I’m reaching out to see how you’re truly doing. Many of us carry invisible burdens that don’t show up on performance reviews. If you’ve been dealing with inner turmoil or unresolved personal stress, our counseling hotline is free, anonymous, and available 24/7. You’re not expected to be strong all the time here.
Just wanted to say I’m here I know you’ve been going through something quiet and heavy lately, and I haven’t pushed you to talk. But I’ve noticed how you’ve pulled back from team chats and coffee breaks. It’s okay to not be okay, and I’m not going to pretend I understand everything. But I’m here if you ever want to say it out loud—or just sit in silence together.
Request to adjust workload temporarily I’m currently dealing with some private emotional challenges that are making it harder to maintain my usual output. I’m not asking for special treatment, just time to recover without judgment. I’ve been managing it outside work hours but the toll is building. Could we revisit my current assignments for the next two weeks? I’ll make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
Observations from team pulse check During recent one-on-ones, several team members disclosed latents struggles with long-term emotional fatigue. Some are managing unresolved trauma or persistent anxiety that impacts daily presence. These aren’t performance issues—these are human issues that require systemic empathy, not just resilience messaging. I recommend implementing trauma-informed check-ins across management tiers.
Hope you’re alright I saw your email to the office about taking a few days and I just wanted to say I know what you’re carrying. You’ve never talked about it much, but I’ve seen how tired you get when you think no one’s watching. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time, even at work. I’m proud of you for reaching out even if it was just to HR. I’m here whenever you need to unload.
Need some time off to work through some things Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight that’s hard to shake off. I’ve been writing in my notebook every night just to make sense of what I’m feeling. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I need space to heal before I can show up fully at work again.
Follow-up on your confidential request I understand you’ve been grappling with internal challenges that aren’t easily visible on the surface. Your honesty in sharing this means a lot, and we’re here to support you through counselling or flexible scheduling. Please know your privacy is paramount, and nothing you’ve disclosed will leave this conversation.
Checking in after your recent absence I noticed you’ve seemed distant the past few weeks, and I want you to know it’s okay if you’re going through something personal. Many of us carry unseen burdens, and I’ve seen how hard you’ve been trying to keep up. If you’d prefer to talk one-on-one, I’m available any time.
Wondering if I can talk about something private I’ve been struggling with feelings I didn’t think I’d still be carrying at this stage in life. Some days it feels like I’m dragging an invisible anchor behind me. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little grace while I figure things out.
Supporting team wellbeing during transition period During times of organisational change, employees often confront long-held emotional patterns that surface unexpectedly. What might look like decreased productivity could be someone processing years of unresolved tension. We encourage managers to approach these moments with quiet empathy, not assumptions.
I’m worried about you You’ve been quieter than usual, and I’ve noticed you’re not sleeping well. I know you don’t like talking about it, but I’ve seen how much you’ve been holding inside since your mom passed. You don’t have to fix it all at once—just let someone sit with you.
Request to adjust workload temporarily I’ve been dealing with some private emotional challenges that are making it hard to focus on deadlines. I’m not sick, and I’m not asking to be excused—I just need a lighter load for a few weeks while I get back on my feet. I’ve already started journaling again to help manage it.
Need some time off to sort through some personal issues I’ve been struggling to focus at work lately because I’m carrying a lot of unresolved emotional weight from the past few years. It’s not something I can just push through or shake off—it’s affecting my sleep, my mood, and my ability to engage with the team. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a short period to see a counselor and get some clarity before I can show up as my best self here.
Follow-up on your recent request for leave I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to navigate personal challenges while trying to maintain professional responsibilities. Many of us carry unspoken burdens that aren’t visible on performance reviews, and I respect your honesty in bringing this up. Please take the time you need—I’ll cover your pending deliverables and check in gently when you’re ready to return.
Confidential support resources available to you As part of our commitment to employee well-being, I wanted to remind you that our EAP program offers free, confidential sessions with licensed therapists who specialize in long-term emotional recovery. You don’t have to explain anything to anyone if you don’t want to—this is entirely private. Healing isn’t linear, and it’s okay to take slow steps toward feeling whole again.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been trying to handle this on my own, but the weight of everything I’ve been holding inside has become too much to carry quietly. It’s not about one event—it’s the accumulation of years of silence, shame, and self-doubt that’s starting to show in how I show up at work. I don’t expect a solution, just a safe space to say it out loud without judgment.
Re: Wellbeing initiative feedback from your team One of your team members shared with me that they’ve been grappling with deep personal fatigue that no amount of time off or flexibility seems to alleviate. They’re not asking for accommodation—they’re asking for recognition that their inner world matters as much as their output. This isn’t performance management—it’s human resilience under strain.
Request for discretion regarding a personal matter I’ve been dealing with some heavy emotional patterns that weren’t visible until recently, and they’ve started impacting my productivity in ways I didn’t anticipate. I’m working with a therapist, but I’m still hesitant to tell more people than necessary. I’d appreciate your understanding if I seem distant or distracted over the next few weeks—I’m not leaving, just healing.
I’m sorry I haven’t been myself I know I’ve been distant lately, and I owe you more than silence. I’ve been carrying grief and regret from things I never let myself process, and it’s finally caught up with me in ways I didn’t expect. I’m not broken—I’m just buried under years of not saying what I needed to say. I’m trying to dig myself out, slowly and quietly.
Need some time off to focus on myself I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight lately that I can’t seem to shake off. It’s affecting my focus and energy at work in ways I didn’t expect. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little space to reset and work through some internal challenges that have been building for months.
Follow-up on your recent request I appreciate you sharing how much you’ve been struggling with unresolved personal issues. I know it’s not easy to speak up, and I want you to know we see you. The EAP resources are still available to you, and I’d be happy to help you schedule a session if you’re open to it. Your well-being matters to this team.
Confidential support options for you As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellness, I wanted to privately remind you that our counseling program covers long-term emotional processing and trauma-informed care. Many people find it helpful to talk through patterns that have lingered for years. You don’t have to face this alone, and your confidentiality is guaranteed.
Can we talk about my workload? Lately I’ve been feeling drained by things I can’t even name out loud, and it’s starting to show in my output. I’ve tried to push through, but the mental load is heavier than I let on. I’m not looking for sympathy—I just need a little flexibility while I get back on solid ground.
Re: Your well-being check-in When I asked how you’ve been, I didn’t expect you to open up the way you did. It’s clear you’re carrying burdens that go beyond typical workplace stress. Many of our clients in similar roles have found structured journaling and peer circles helpful—would you be willing to try one?
I’ve been thinking about you I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I just wanted to say I’m here if you need to unload. You’ve carried so much on your own for so long—no one should have to bear that weight alone. Healing doesn’t happen overnight, but I’m not going anywhere.
Overwhelmed and needing help I’ve been trying to manage old wounds while keeping up with deadlines, and it’s becoming impossible. The anxiety doesn’t go away after hours—it follows me home. I know this isn’t a typical HR issue, but I’m reaching out because I don’t know where else to turn.
Need some time off — personal reasons Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of weight I haven’t talked about with anyone at work. The anxiety has been getting harder to hide, and I’m starting to feel like I’m just going through the motions. I don’t want to fall behind, but I need a few days to reconnect with myself and get some professional support. I promise I’ll have everything covered before I leave and will check in remotely if absolutely necessary.
Follow-up on your recent leave request Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through — it takes courage to speak up about emotional strain in the workplace. Your well-being matters to us, and we’ve noted your need for space to process personal challenges. I’ve arranged for you to speak with our Employee Assistance Program counselor next week, and we can discuss flexible return options if needed. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if things feel overwhelming before then.
Checking in — I noticed you’ve been quiet lately I’ve observed that you’ve been withdrawing in team meetings and seem more withdrawn than usual. I’m not here to pry, but I want you to know I’ve noticed, and I care. If there’s something personal going on that’s affecting your energy, I’m here to listen — no judgment, no pressure. Your mental health isn’t a burden; it’s part of why you’re valuable here.
Quick request — I need to adjust my schedule I’ve been dealing with some deep emotional fatigue that’s harder to manage than I expected, and it’s starting to affect my focus. I’ve been seeing a therapist and they’ve recommended I carve out some quiet hours during the day to recharge. Would it be possible to shift my core hours to later in the day? I’ll make sure my deliverables are still on time.
Observations from the well-being survey Many respondents noted that unresolved personal stress is quietly eroding productivity and engagement. Some described feeling trapped between professional obligations and internal turmoil they can’t articulate at work. When people feel unsafe sharing their emotional burdens, silence becomes the default — and that’s when burnout takes root. We recommend creating safe channels for these confessions to be heard, not just tracked.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve seen the way you’ve been sleeping — or not sleeping — and how your voice sounds when you answer the phone. You used to write poetry, and now you don’t even open your journal. I’m not asking you to explain everything, but I’m here if you ever want to talk about what’s inside you. You don’t have to carry all of it alone.
Request to discuss work adjustments — private matter I’ve been struggling with something I haven’t shared with anyone here, and it’s starting to make my work feel unsustainable. It’s not something I can just snap out of, and I’m afraid of being seen as unreliable. I’m not asking for special treatment, just understanding — maybe a temporary reduction in meetings or deadlines? I’m committed to my role, but I need a little room to breathe.
Need some time off to work through some personal issues Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of weight from past experiences that I haven’t properly processed. It’s starting to affect my focus and energy at work, and I know I need to address it before it gets worse. I’ve started seeing a therapist and it’s helping me unpack things I’ve kept buried for years. I’m not asking for special treatment—just a few weeks of leave to focus on my mental health without the added stress of daily responsibilities.
Follow-up on your confidential wellbeing request Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through during our private conversation last week. Many employees carry internal challenges that go unspoken, and your courage in reaching out is appreciated. Our EAP program can connect you with a licensed counselor who specializes in trauma-informed care and long-term emotional recovery. Please know your privacy is strictly protected, and no details will be shared beyond what you authorize.
Checking in after your recent leave I noticed you seemed more present this week, and I wanted to say I’ve noticed a difference in your demeanor since you came back. I don’t need to know the specifics, but I want you to know that supporting your well-being isn’t just policy—it’s personal. People don’t always say it, but teams notice when someone is healing, and we’re glad you’re taking the space you needed.
Request for flexible hours – personal healing process I’ve been working through some deep-seated psychological stress that’s been affecting my daily rhythm, and I’m in the middle of a structured recovery plan. While I’m still fully committed to my tasks, I need to adjust my hours temporarily to accommodate weekly therapy sessions and morning mindfulness practices. This isn’t a phase I’m rushing through—it’s necessary for me to show up as my best self long-term.
Observations from our wellbeing workshop Several participants expressed how unresolved past experiences continue to influence their work performance, often without them realizing it. One individual mentioned how childhood patterns of self-blame still echo in high-pressure situations, making it hard to accept feedback. These aren’t just individual issues—they’re organizational blind spots that reduce resilience and increase turnover if left unaddressed.
Apologies for my recent withdrawal I’ve been quietly struggling with feelings of inadequacy that have nothing to do with my role and everything to do with old wounds resurfacing. I know I’ve been distant and quiet lately, and I’m sorry if it seemed like disengagement. I’ve started journaling and talking with a professional, and slowly I’m learning to separate who I am from what I’ve been told I am.
I’m worried about you I noticed you’ve been cancelling plans again, and when we do talk, you sound exhausted even when you say you’re fine. I don’t know what you’re carrying, but I’ve seen this pattern before—in Dad, in Aunt Marie—and it doesn’t just fade on its own. Please talk to someone. You don’t have to go through it alone, and I’m not asking for details—just that you let someone in.
Need some time off to deal with some personal issues I’ve been carrying a lot of weight on my shoulders lately, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I don’t want to make it a big deal, but I need a few days to reconnect with myself and get some professional support. This isn’t something I’m comfortable discussing in detail, but I hope you understand it’s urgent for my well-being.
Follow-up on your confidential request Thank you for sharing your experiences during our recent check-in. Many employees in your position face internal challenges that are hard to articulate, and I want you to know your privacy is respected. Our EAP counselor is available at your convenience, and there’s no pressure to disclose more than you’re ready to. Healing isn’t linear, and taking time for yourself is not a weakness.
Talking about what’s been going on I’ve noticed you’ve seemed distant the past few weeks, and I wanted to reach out with care, not judgment. If you’re dealing with something private that’s hard to talk about, please know I’m here to listen — no need to explain unless you want to. Your mental health matters as much as your output, and I’ll adjust your workload as needed.
Can we talk privately? Lately I’ve been wrestling with thoughts I’ve never shared with anyone at work, and it’s draining me more than I let on. I don’t need advice — just space and understanding while I work through this on my own terms. I’m still meeting deadlines, but I’m not okay, and pretending I am is making it worse.
Supporting team well-being in remote settings Remote work can amplify silent burdens — isolation, unresolved grief, or emotional fatigue that no one else sees. I’ve seen teams thrive when leaders create safe channels for these quiet struggles to be acknowledged without stigma. Sometimes the most impactful intervention is simply saying, “I see you’re carrying something heavy.”
I’m sorry I’ve been quiet I know I’ve been pulling away lately, and I owe you an explanation even if it’s messy. I’ve been stuck in my own head with stuff I didn’t know how to fix, let alone talk about. It’s not about you — it’s about me trying to heal from years of holding everything in. I’m slowly getting help, and I hope you’ll be patient with me.
Request for flexibility on upcoming deadlines I’ve been managing some deeply personal challenges that aren’t easy to discuss, and they’re affecting my energy more than I expected. I’m not asking for leniency out of avoidance — I’m asking because I care about doing good work, and I need a bit of breathing room to keep going. I’ll update you as I’m able, but I appreciate the discretion.
Need some time off to focus on myself I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight lately that’s starting to affect my work. It’s not something I’m comfortable sharing in detail, but I need a few days to reset and deal with some personal issues. I’m not asking for a leave of absence, just a short break to regain balance. I’ve been seeing a counselor and it’s helping, but I need space to breathe. I’ll make sure my tasks are covered before I go.
Follow-up on your recent request for support Thank you for being open about the inner struggles you’ve been experiencing. We understand these kinds of challenges are deeply personal and often hard to articulate. Our EAP program offers confidential sessions with licensed therapists who specialize in emotional baggage and long-term coping. You’re not alone in this, and we’re here to support you without judgment. Please let us know if you’d like help scheduling your first appointment.
Checking in on your wellbeing I’ve noticed you’ve seemed distant over the past few weeks and I wanted to reach out privately. You don’t have to explain anything, but I want you to know I see you and I care. Work shouldn’t be adding to the burden you’re already carrying. If you need adjustments to your workload or a temporary shift in deadlines, just say the word. Your mental health matters more than any KPI.
Quick favor before I leave for the week I’m heading out for a few days to sort through some heavy personal stuff. It’s nothing dramatic, just something I’ve needed to face for a while now. I’ve delegated all urgent items to Priya and left detailed notes in the shared folder. I won’t be checking email much, but I’ll be back fully present on Monday. Thanks for understanding.
Re: Employee wellness initiative feedback During our recent intake interviews, several staff members referenced unresolved trauma and long-term emotional strain as barriers to engagement. These aren’t issues that can be solved with team-building exercises—they require real psychological support. I urge you to expand access to trauma-informed counseling and normalize conversations around internal battles. People are suffering in silence because they fear stigma.
Just wanted to say I’m here I know you’ve been carrying things for a long time without talking about them. I don’t need you to explain what’s going on, but I want you to know you’re not isolated in this. Sometimes the heaviest burdens aren’t visible, but they’re real—and you deserve to feel lighter. I’ll be around, even if you just need to sit in silence. You’ve always been there for others. Let me be there for you now.
Request to work remotely next week I’m dealing with some deeply personal emotional challenges that are harder to manage while in the office. Being at home will give me the space I need to process without the added pressure of performing. I’ll be fully available during work hours and have all my deliverables on track. I’m not asking for sympathy, just a little flexibility so I can show up as my best self.
Need some time off to sort some things out Lately I’ve been carrying a heavy weight that’s hard to explain. It’s not just stress from work—it’s deeper, something I’ve been avoiding for years. I’m starting therapy next week, but I need a couple of days to get settled before I return fully. I know it’s not typical, but this isn’t something I can push through alone.
Follow-up on your recent request for leave I appreciate your honesty about the emotional toll this past year has taken on you. Many of us carry unseen burdens that affect focus, sleep, and overall well-being. Your decision to prioritize mental health is valid and supported by company policy. Please let me know if you’d like resources for counseling or a quiet space to decompress during your return.
Checking in after your last week I noticed you’ve been quieter lately and wanted to say I’ve seen the effort you’re putting in despite how drained you seem. You don’t have to pretend everything’s fine around here. If you need space to breathe or adjust your schedule, I’ve got your back. Your value isn’t tied to always being “on.”
Can we talk privately? I’ve been struggling with something I haven’t told anyone at work. It’s not about the project deadlines—it’s about the way I’ve been feeling inside for months. Some days, it’s hard to get out of bed, and I’m scared it’s affecting how others see me. I don’t want pity, just understanding. I’d appreciate the chance to speak when it’s just you and me.
Re: Employee wellness program feedback Several team members have shared that the pressure to appear resilient has made them suppress their emotional needs. This isn’t about burnout—it’s about unresolved personal pain bleeding into daily performance. A safe channel to disclose without stigma could reduce long-term attrition. I’ve seen this pattern in other organizations, and the cost of silence is high.
I’m sorry I’ve been distant I haven’t been myself lately, and I know it’s been obvious. The grief I thought I’d moved past has come back in ways I didn’t expect. I’m working through it, slowly, but I’ve been too ashamed to say anything. I need to know you won’t judge me for not being strong all the time. I’m trying, even when it doesn’t look like it.
Apologies for the last email – it wasn’t professional I sent a message yesterday that was out of line, and I owe you an explanation, not an excuse. I’ve been battling panic attacks in silence, and when I’m overwhelmed, I react poorly. I’m meeting with our EAP provider next week and have already started journaling. I’m ashamed I lashed out, but I’m not ashamed I need help.
Need some time off to sort through some personal stuff I’ve been carrying a lot of unresolved pain from previous relationships, and it’s starting to weigh on my daily work. I don’t feel like I’m performing at my best, and I think taking a short break would help me reset. I’m not looking for sympathy, just space to heal without judgment. This isn’t something I’m comfortable discussing in detail, but I trust you’ll respect my privacy. I’ll have my tasks covered before I leave, and I’m happy to coordinate handovers.
Follow-up on confidential wellness request Thank you for sharing your experience regarding lingering emotional strain from past connections. We recognize how deeply personal this is and want to ensure you have access to our Employee Assistance Program. Your mental well-being directly impacts your long-term engagement, and we’re here to support you without requiring disclosure. Please know your confidentiality is strictly protected under company policy. If you’d prefer to speak with someone outside HR, we can arrange a confidential session with an external counselor.
Checking in — I noticed you’ve been quiet lately I’ve observed you’ve seemed distant over the past few weeks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. If you’re carrying weight from old experiences that’s affecting your focus or energy, please know I’m not here to pry — just to offer support. Many people carry invisible burdens from relationships they thought they’d moved on from. I’ve been there too, and I know how draining it can be to pretend it doesn’t exist. You’re not alone in this, and I’m open to listening if you ever want to talk.
Personal leave request — urgent I need to step away for a few days to deal with some deeply personal emotional wounds that have resurfaced. These aren’t workplace issues, but they’re impacting my ability to concentrate and show up reliably. I’ve been trying to manage them on my own, but the toll is becoming too great. I’m not seeking an explanation or intervention — just time to process without pressure. I’ll be reachable in emergencies but ask that I not be disturbed otherwise.
Supporting team well-being — gentle reminder It’s common for employees to carry unresolved emotional history that surfaces during high-stress periods, even if unspoken. These unseen burdens often manifest as withdrawal, reduced productivity, or uncharacteristic irritability. As part of holistic team care, I encourage leaders to normalize quiet support rather than assume disengagement is performance-related. Many simply need space to heal, not scrutiny. A simple “I’m here if you need it” can make all the difference.
Can we talk? I know we haven’t spoken in months, but I’ve been thinking about how much I still hold onto from what happened between us. It’s not about blaming anyone — it’s about finally facing how it’s altered my sense of safety at work and home. I’ve started therapy, but I needed to tell someone who knew me before the damage set in. I don’t expect you to fix anything — just to know I’m trying to let go.
Your wellness survey response triggered a support alert We noticed your recent survey indicated persistent stress tied to past interpersonal experiences. This is more common than you might think, and our internal resources are designed precisely for this kind of emotional residue. You’re not obligated to share details, but we’d like to offer anonymous counseling access and a private journaling tool. These tools have helped others untangle long-standing emotional knots without involving colleagues. Your privacy is our priority.
Need some time off for personal reasons Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight that’s hard to explain. I’ve been struggling with inner demons I didn’t think I’d still be fighting this long into my career. It’s not something I can just shake off at the office door, and I need a few days to focus on myself without judgment. I’m not asking for special treatment, just space to breathe.
Follow-up on confidential wellbeing request Thank you for sharing your experience with us in confidence. Many employees carry emotional baggage from past trauma or prolonged stress, and we want to ensure you’re connected with the right resources. Your honesty is appreciated, and our counseling partnership is available whenever you’re ready. Please know this conversation stays strictly between you and our support team.
Checking in after your recent absence I noticed you’ve been quieter lately and wanted to see how you’re doing. Life has a way of piling up internal struggles that don’t show up on performance reviews, and I care about you beyond your output. If you need flexibility or just someone to listen, I’m here. You don’t have to go through this alone.
Can we talk? It’s personal I’ve been trying to hold it together for months, but the emotional toll is starting to affect my focus. I’ve been dealing with deep-seated issues that no one at work knows about, and I’m finally ready to ask for help. I don’t want to be seen as weak—I just need to heal without the pressure.
Support options for team members under strain I’ve observed a pattern among several staff members who express exhaustion not from workload, but from unresolved personal burdens. These are often silent struggles—loneliness, guilt, grief—that erode resilience over time. I recommend we offer discreet access to trauma-informed coaching, not just EAP brochures.
Hope you’re okay I know you’ve been quiet since you started this new role, and I’m worried. You used to write letters, now you just send texts. I understand if work is heavy, but I want you to know I see you—even when you don’t say it. You don’t have to be strong all the time.
Request to work remotely next week – urgent personal matter I need to take a short break from the office to deal with something deeply personal that I haven’t been able to talk about. I’ve been managing trauma that’s been weighing on me for years, and I need quiet space to process it without the noise of daily demands. I’ll be fully available online and will respond to anything critical. This isn’t a request I make lightly.
Need time off for personal health reasons I’ve been dealing with some deep-seated emotional issues that have been affecting my daily focus and energy levels. My counselor has recommended a short break to work through past trauma that I’ve been carrying for years. I’m not comfortable sharing all the details, but I hope you understand this is something I need to address seriously. I’ll be available by email for urgent matters and plan to return in two weeks.
Follow-up on your recent request I wanted to check in after your conversation with HR about the leave you requested. I realize you’ve been carrying a lot of personal weight lately, and I appreciate your honesty in bringing it up. Your well-being matters to us, and I support you taking the time you need to heal. Please let me know if there’s anything we can do to make the transition smoother when you come back.
Confidential: Employee Assistance Program referral You’ve been referred to our EAP due to observed changes in your engagement and emotional presence at work. This isn’t a disciplinary matter—it’s a proactive step to help you process what you’ve been enduring privately. Many people struggle with unresolved stress and inner tension that impacts performance without being visible on the surface. You’re not alone, and the support is completely confidential.
Quick ask about flexible hours I’ve been trying to manage some long-term personal challenges that require consistent therapy sessions during work hours. It’s not easy to talk about, but I’ve hit a point where I need to prioritize my mental health to keep showing up at all. I’m happy to adjust my schedule, work remotely on therapy days, or make up time later. I’d really appreciate your understanding.
Observations from team wellness check-in During our recent wellbeing survey, several team members indicated they’re grappling with unaddressed emotional stressors that stem from prolonged personal hardship. One participant described feeling buried under years of unprocessed grief and guilt, which is now manifesting in absenteeism and disengagement. I strongly recommend we introduce structured peer support circles and mental health resources tailored to this kind of hidden burden.
I need to talk about something hard I’ve been meaning to tell you how much I’ve noticed you’ve been withdrawing lately, and it’s killing me to see you carry this alone. You’ve always been the strong one, but I know you’ve been silently battling things since Dad passed. It’s okay to not be okay, and I’m here—not to fix you, but to sit with you while you sort it out. Please just let me in, even a little.
Your EAP session is confirmed Your session with licensed counselor Dr. Lin has been scheduled for Thursday at 3PM EST. This appointment is part of your company’s confidential emotional wellness program designed to support employees managing personal trauma or chronic inner distress. No explanation to your manager is required—you are entitled to this support without judgment. Please arrive 10 minutes early to complete intake forms.
Just needed to say I’m struggling today It’s been a tough day dealing with anxiety and I’m finding it hard to focus on anything. I’ve been holding it together in meetings, but I’m emotionally drained and need a little space to breathe. I know it’s not ideal to mention this at work, but I wanted to be honest before I fall behind.
Following up on your note yesterday I noticed you mentioned having a difficult period lately and I want you to know I see you. You don’t have to push through this alone — the EAP program is available, and I can help you schedule time off if needed. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline right now.
Resources for personal challenges I reached out because your recent conversation about your emotional state stayed with me. If you're going through a rough patch, our confidential counseling service is free and available 24/7. You’re not expected to be perfect, especially when life gets overwhelming. Take care of yourself first.
Need to step out early today I’ve had a really hard time lately with my mental health and today was one of those days where getting out of bed felt impossible. I’m not sick, just exhausted from internal battles no one sees. I’d appreciate if you could approve an early departure — I need to reset before tomorrow.
Can we grab coffee this afternoon? I’ve been going through a rough patch myself and I thought maybe you’d understand. I’ve been having trouble sleeping and every little thing feels heavier than it should. I don’t need advice — just someone who won’t tell me to “snap out of it.”
Request for flexibility this week I’ve been managing a very difficult situation at home that’s starting to affect my work output. I’m not looking for sympathy, just understanding. Can we talk about adjusting my hours or moving some deadlines? I promise I’ll make up the time.
Re: Employee feedback session One of your team members shared that they’ve been wrestling with prolonged emotional strain and aren’t sure how to ask for help. I think this points to a gap in psychological safety. Let’s consider adding quiet channels for personal disclosures — things people won’t say in front of a manager.
Need some time off soon I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately because my mental health has been really rough. It’s not just stress—it’s been affecting my sleep, my focus, and even my ability to get out of bed some mornings. I’m not asking for a leave of absence just yet, but I need to talk about adjusting my workload for a bit. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine when it’s not.
Checking in after your recent note I noticed you mentioned things have been overwhelming lately, and I want you to know I take that seriously. You don’t have to go it alone—I’m happy to rearrange deadlines or connect you with our EAP counselor. Your well-being matters more than any project timeline, and I’d rather you take the space you need than burn out. Please let me know what would help most right now.
Confidential support resources available Many employees find themselves dealing with emotional or psychological strain without realizing how common it is. You’re not alone, and you don’t have to manage it silently. Our confidential counseling service is open to anyone, no questions asked, and available 24/7. You can reach out anytime—even if you’re just feeling drained or numb. Your privacy is guaranteed, and this isn’t a performance issue; it’s a human issue.
Can we chat about my schedule? Lately I’ve been finding it harder to keep up with daily tasks because I’m dealing with a lot on the personal front. I’m not sick, but I’m not at my best either, and I’m worried I’m falling behind. I’d appreciate some flexibility in my hours for the next few weeks—maybe starting later or working remotely on tough days. I’m still committed, I just need a little breathing room.
You’re not alone in this I saw you looked off yesterday and I wanted to say I get it. There were months last year when I couldn’t even face Zoom calls, and I felt like I was failing at everything. It’s okay to not be okay, especially when your mind is running on empty. If you want to grab coffee after work—or just vent—I’m here. You don’t need to be strong all the time.
I’m sorry I’ve been quiet I know I’ve missed several deadlines and haven’t responded to your messages, and I owe you an explanation. I’ve been dealing with a prolonged period of emotional exhaustion that’s made it hard to think clearly, let alone work. It’s not an excuse, but it’s the truth. I’m getting help and I’m working my way back—please know I haven’t abandoned this, I’m just trying to survive it first.
Following up on your well-being check-in I understand you’ve been navigating a difficult personal time, and I want to thank you for having the courage to mention it. Many people push through in silence, but your willingness to acknowledge it is a sign of strength, not weakness. As your external partner, I’m here to adjust expectations and reduce pressure however I can. Your health comes before deliverables—always.
Need some time off to regroup This has been a difficult period after the loss, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I’ve been trying to keep up, but the grief is heavier than I expected. I’d appreciate it if we could talk about adjusting my workload for the next couple of weeks. I’m not asking for leave yet, just some flexibility until I find my footing again.
Feeling overwhelmed lately Lately, every day feels like a struggle to get through the morning, let alone the rest of the day. The weight of everything since my mother passed hasn’t lifted, and I’m just trying to keep going without falling apart. I know I’m still meeting deadlines, but it’s taking everything I have. I’d be grateful for any understanding or support you can offer during this time.
Checking in after your father’s passing I’ve been thinking about you since I heard about your father, and I want you to know I’m here if you need to talk or just need space. I know no amount of time is enough, but please don’t feel pressured to be “back to normal.” Your team is covering for you, and your well-being matters more than any project right now.
Support resources available during bereavement I understand you’re navigating a challenging time following the death of your partner, and I want to ensure you’re aware of our counseling services and extended leave options. It’s completely normal to feel drained, unfocused, or emotionally raw right now. You’re not alone in this, and HR is here to help you access what you need without judgment or delay.
Just wanted to say I get it I lost my sister last year, and I remember how the smallest things — like walking into the kitchen or hearing a certain song — would just knock the wind out of me. You’re not weak for feeling this way, and you don’t have to act like everything’s fine. If you want to skip a meeting or just sit in silence at lunch, I’ve got your back.
Apologies for my recent performance I’ve been dealing with the aftermath of losing my brother, and I know my responsiveness has been down. It’s not an excuse, but I’m still learning how to carry this burden without letting it crush me. I’m working on regaining my rhythm, and I’m deeply sorry if I’ve let the team down. I’m committed to getting back on track, but I might need a little patience.
I’m so sorry for your loss I know how close you were to her, and I can only imagine how hollow things feel now. You don’t owe anyone a smile or a reply, and you shouldn’t pretend to be okay when you’re not. I’m not asking for anything — just want you to know I’m here, whether you need to cry, rage, or just sit in silence with someone who remembers her too.
Need some time off this week The past few weeks have been a difficult situation emotionally, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I’ve been dealing with some family health issues that have taken a heavy toll on me. I’m not asking for a long break, just a couple of days to reset and get my head straight. I’ll make sure all my pending tasks are covered before I go.
Checking in after your recent leave I noticed you’ve been quieter lately, and I want you to know I’ve seen how tough things have been for you. It’s okay to have moments where work feels overwhelming — your well-being matters more than any deadline. Let me know if you’d like to adjust your workload or talk through anything, even just to vent. You’re not alone in this.
Follow-up on your confidential request Thank you for sharing how emotionally draining this period has been — your honesty is appreciated. We’ve noted your request for flexible hours and will process the adjustment by Friday. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need access to our EAP or counseling referrals. Your mental health is a priority here, not a burden.
Just needed to say this privately Lately, I’ve felt like I’m carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and it’s starting to show. I haven’t told many people, but the last month has been one of the hardest times I’ve ever faced. I’m trying to stay professional, but some days I’m just barely holding it together. I don’t expect sympathy, just understanding.
Hey, you okay? I know you’ve been going through a lot lately and I haven’t said much, but I’ve noticed. Some weeks feel like they’ll never end, especially when you’re carrying grief or stress alone. I’ve been there too — it’s okay to not be okay. If you ever want to grab coffee or just sit quietly, I’m here. No pressure.
Re: Your emotional well-being assessment Based on your self-report, it’s clear you’ve been enduring prolonged emotional strain, likely tied to personal instability outside work. Many professionals in your position experience similar challenges during life transitions, and you’re far from alone. We recommend structured support — not as a corrective, but as a sustainable practice. Your resilience is evident, but even the strongest need rest.
Request to adjust meeting schedule I’ve been struggling to maintain my usual output, and it’s not due to lack of effort — I’ve had some deeply personal issues weighing on me. The last few weeks have been exhausting, and I’m trying to manage everything without falling apart. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little more flexibility in scheduling. I promise I’m still committed to the team.
Can we talk later today? I’m really struggling to get through today and I don’t know who else to reach out to. Everything feels heavier than usual, and I just need to vent to someone who gets it. I’m not asking for solutions—just someone to listen. I’ll be in the break room around 3 if you’re free.
Following up on your recent note I wanted to check in after your message yesterday about feeling overwhelmed. It’s completely valid to go through periods like this, and you’re not alone in it. Our EAP program is available anytime, and I’m happy to help you set up a session with a counselor. No pressure, but I care about your wellbeing.
Quick chat when you’re ready I noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn this week, and I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. If you’re going through a rough patch personally, I’m here to support you—not to judge or rush you. There’s no expectation to perform at full capacity right now. Take what you need.
Need a minute to talk Lately, I’ve been finding it hard to keep up with daily tasks because I’m emotionally drained. It’s not laziness—I’m just carrying a lot internally and it’s taking a toll. I don’t want to make a big deal out of it, but I’d really appreciate talking to someone who understands.
Re: Wellbeing check-in As part of our ongoing mental health support initiative, I encourage you to share anything you’re navigating privately. Many people go through difficult periods without realizing they have space to speak up. Your silence won’t be taken as weakness—it’s a sign you’re trying to handle it alone.
Just checking on you I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried you’re carrying something heavy. You don’t have to explain everything, but I’m here—if you need to cry, scream, or just sit in silence together. I’m not going anywhere.
Can we speak in private? I’ve been having a hard time lately and I’m afraid it’s affecting my work. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little understanding while I sort some personal things out. I’ve tried to push through, but I’m at a point where I need to be honest. I trust you to keep this confidential.
Feeling overwhelmed lately It’s been a tough time adjusting to the new normal after the office closed permanently. I’m struggling to separate work from home life and have been waking up anxious most mornings. I know everyone’s adapting differently, but I’m finding it hard to keep up without the structure I used to have. I’m not asking for special treatment, just wondering if there’s any support available through EAP.
Checking in on your well-being I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter in team meetings and haven’t joined the virtual coffee chats lately. I want you to know it’s okay to have a difficult period right now, especially with everything going on personally. If you need flex hours or time off to regroup, please don’t hesitate to say so. Your mental health matters more than any deadline.
Re: Request for leave due to personal circumstances Thank you for sharing what you’re going through — it’s clear this has been a challenging season for you. We understand that adjusting to major life changes can take time, and we’re here to support you through our wellness program. Your confidentiality is protected, and we can arrange a private session with our counselor if you’d like. Please let me know how else we can help.
Need to talk about my schedule Things have been tough since my mum moved in with me — caring for her while working full time has drained me completely. I’m not burning out, but I’m close, and I need to reset my hours for a few weeks. I’ve been managing, but I can’t keep this pace without breaking. I’m not asking for pity, just understanding.
Follow-up on well-being survey response Your anonymous feedback indicated you’re navigating a prolonged period of emotional strain. Many employees in your cohort are experiencing similar challenges with work-life boundaries. Our partner therapists offer confidential, one-on-one sessions tailored to transition fatigue. You don’t have to endure this alone — even small steps toward support can make a difference.
Personal request — off tomorrow I’m dealing with some heavy personal stuff this week and need to take tomorrow off. I know it’s short notice, but I’ve been trying to push through and it’s just not working. It’s been a rough stretch emotionally, and I need space to breathe without the pressure of Slack messages. I’ll clear my inbox before I leave and be back Friday.
Just checking in I saw your message about how hard this transition has been and I want you to know I see you. No one tells you how isolating it is when your whole routine crumbles overnight. You don’t have to pretend you’re fine. I’m here to listen, even if it’s just at midnight when you can’t sleep. You’re not weak for needing a break — you’re human.
Need some time off — things are falling apart I’ve been trying to hold it together for weeks, but this recent stretch has broken me. My mom’s health is declining fast, and I’m the only one who can coordinate her care. I’m not asking for sympathy — just a few days to breathe and get things sorted. I know work won’t stop, but I can’t keep running on empty like this.
Following up on your request for leave I understand you’re going through an incredibly tough personal time, and I want to assure you we’re here to support you. Your performance has never been in question — this is about your well-being. Please let HR know if you need help accessing counseling or flexible hours while you navigate this. You’re not alone in this.
Confidential: Resources for emotional hardship We’ve noticed your recent absence pattern and want to offer confidential support before things escalate. Many employees face similar pressures with family, finances, or mental health, and we have quiet programs to help. You don’t need to explain anything to anyone — just reach out privately. Your silence won’t protect you; our care will.
Can we talk about my workload? I’ve been struggling to focus lately — it’s not laziness, it’s grief weighing on me every single morning. I’ve lost someone close, and the quiet moments between tasks feel unbearable. I’m not quitting, but I need structure adjusted for a bit — maybe shorter days, no meetings on Fridays. I’ll make up the work. I just can’t do it like before.
You okay? I saw how you left the team call yesterday and just wanted to say I noticed. I’ve been through something similar — when your partner left and you had to pretend everything was fine at work. It’s exhausting faking normal. If you want to grab coffee after hours, I’m here. No pressure. Just know you don’t have to smile through it alone.
On behalf of our client — emotional wellbeing check-in Our client has asked me to gently check in, as your recent patterns suggest you may be carrying a heavy personal load. This isn’t about productivity metrics — it’s about sustainability. Many of our teams have accessed their internal emotional support line without stigma, and the results have been transformative. You’re not failing. You’re human.
Request for discretion regarding personal matter I need to take a short leave, but I’m not comfortable sharing details in writing or with the team. I’ve dealt with this before and know how rumors spread. I’ll provide documentation if required, but please keep this between us. I’ll be reachable for critical issues, but I need space to recover. Thank you for respecting my privacy.
Need a quiet day tomorrow I’m finding it hard to shake off the weight of the past few days. Things at home have been overwhelming, and I’m not sure I can bring my best self into the office. Could I possibly work remotely or take a single day to reset? I know it’s short notice, but I’d really appreciate the flexibility.
Following up on your recent message I noticed you mentioned things have been tough lately, and I want you to know I see you. It’s okay to have moments where everything feels heavy. I’ve arranged for you to have next Wednesday off with no expectations—you’ve earned it. Please reach out if you need anything, even just someone to listen.
Wellness check-in – confidential Your recent self-disclosure in the employee assistance program survey has been noted with care. Many of our team members face similar challenges without voicing them, and you’re not alone. Our counseling service is available 24/7, and I’ve already reserved you a slot with our specialist. Your privacy is protected at every step.
Can we talk? Lately I’ve been going through a rough patch, and it’s affecting how I show up at work. I don’t want to make excuses, but I need to be honest—some days I barely have the energy to get out of bed. I’m trying to get support outside of work, but having a little grace here would mean the world.
You okay? I saw you staring at your screen all morning and just wanted to check in. I’ve been there too—when the world feels like it’s pressing down and you don’t know how to say it out loud. You don’t have to explain anything, but if you want to grab coffee or just sit in silence, I’m here.
Request for temporary adjustment I’ve been dealing with some personal hardships that are making it hard to maintain my usual pace. I’m not asking for a leave of absence, just a slight reduction in meeting load over the next two weeks. I’m committed to my work, but I need a little breathing room to get through this.
Re: Employee Wellbeing Initiative While reviewing your internal feedback, I noticed a pattern of quiet distress among staff who avoid formal channels. Many express exhaustion and isolation without naming it directly. I recommend a pilot program that normalizes emotional vulnerability—simple, anonymous check-ins could prevent burnout before it escalates.
Need some time off this week I’ve been going through a really hard time since my relationship ended last month. Everyday feels heavier than the last, and I’m struggling to focus at work. I don’t want to make a big deal out of it, but I need a few days to reset and get some emotional space. I’ll make sure all my tasks are handed off before I leave.
Following up on your request I understand you’ve been dealing with a tough stretch since your breakup, and I want you to know your wellbeing matters more than any deadline. Please take the time you need, even if it extends beyond the three days we discussed. We’ll cover your client meetings and I’ll personally check in next week to see how you’re doing.
Emotional support resources available We’ve noticed your recent leave pattern and want to offer support during this difficult transition. Our EAP program provides free counseling sessions with specialists trained in relationship loss and emotional recovery. You don’t need to explain anything to us—just call the hotline and mention your employee ID. You’re not alone in this.
Just wanted to share something Things haven’t been easy since I split up with my partner. I’ve been waking up feeling hollow and it’s been hard to fake being okay. I’m trying to get through each day, but I’m not sleeping well and I’ve lost my appetite. I don’t expect anything to change, but I needed to say it to someone who might understand.
Re: Employee wellbeing check-in During our recent review, I sensed you’ve been carrying a heavy emotional load. The last few weeks have clearly taken a toll on your energy and engagement. If you’re open to it, I can connect you with a confidential coach who specializes in post-breakup adjustment for professionals. No one needs to know you reached out.
Hope you’re holding up I heard you’ve been going through a rough patch lately and I just wanted to say I’m here for you. I know how hard it is to navigate life when everything feels like it’s falling apart. You don’t have to put on a brave face around me—I remember what it felt like after my divorce. Take all the time you need to heal.
Not feeling well this week I’ve been dealing with a prolonged period of low mood and physical fatigue since my relationship ended. It’s not depression, not exactly, but it’s close enough that I can’t seem to shake it. I’m not asking for special treatment—I just need to work from home for a few days so I can breathe. I’ll be on email if anything urgent comes up.
Need some time off — things are overwhelming I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately, and it’s not because I’m lazy or disengaged. I’m dealing with a really difficult period personally, and I don’t have the mental bandwidth to show up the way I used to. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little space to breathe and get my head straight.
Following up on your recent request I want you to know I take your message seriously, and I’m not going to pretend I fully understand what you’re going through. But I can see how this tough day after tough day is wearing you down. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help ease your load, even temporarily. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Confidential: Support resources available I noticed you’ve been absent more frequently lately, and I want you to know this isn’t going unnoticed. Many of our team members have walked through similar situations — loss, burnout, family strain — and found comfort in our EAP program. You don’t have to carry this alone, and no one needs to know you reached out unless you want them to.
Hey — you okay? I know you’ve been quiet this week, and I’m not trying to pry, but I’ve been there too. Sometimes life just hits you with a situation you didn’t see coming and you feel completely unprepared. If you want to grab coffee or just vent without judgment, I’m here. No pressure, no notes, no HR copies.
Request for flexibility — personal reasons I’ve been trying to manage some private family matters on my own, but lately it’s become too much to handle on top of my responsibilities. I’m not saying this to gain sympathy, just to be honest about why my output has dipped. I’m committed to my role, but I need a bit more wiggle room until things stabilize.
Re: Employee wellbeing check-in During our recent one-on-one, you mentioned being caught in a prolonged emotional struggle that’s affecting your focus. I want to emphasize that this kind of pressure is more common than people admit, especially in high-expectation environments. You’re not failing — you’re human. Our contract allows for confidential wellbeing support; I can connect you quietly.
Just checking in — don’t tell anyone I emailed this I know you’ve been putting on a brave face at work, but I’ve seen how tired you are. You’ve been dealing with this heavy burden for weeks now, and I wish you’d let me help more. You don’t have to explain everything to your boss or HR — just know I’m here, and you’re not alone in this. I love you.
Just needed to say I’m struggling I’ve had one of those weeks where every small thing felt overwhelming. It started with a rough morning and just kept getting heavier. I’m not sure when it will lift, but I needed to tell someone before I cracked under the silence.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned things have been particularly hard lately, and I want you to know I see you. It’s okay to take time when life piles up like this. Please consider using your EAP benefits — they’re there for moments like this, not just crises.
Reaching out regarding your leave request Your note about the prolonged emotional strain didn’t go unnoticed, and I appreciate your honesty. Many of our team members have walked similar paths during tough transitions. We can extend your temporary leave or adjust workload — what would feel most supportive right now?
Can we talk? I haven’t been myself for weeks, and I’m not sure how to say it without sounding weak. The grief won’t let up, and work feels like wading through wet concrete. I know this isn’t typical, but I’m reaching out because I don’t want to disappear.
Request for flexibility in schedule My personal circumstances have become more demanding than I anticipated, and I’m finding it harder to maintain focus during core hours. I’m not asking for special treatment — just a bit of understanding as I navigate this quiet storm. I’ll keep delivering on deadlines, I promise.
Sensitive matter — private response requested I’ve observed a pattern among several staff members who are silently enduring extended periods of emotional exhaustion. Many aren’t speaking up because they fear judgment or career repercussions. If you’re open to it, I’d like to propose a confidential wellbeing check-in protocol.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been putting on a brave face at work, but I’ve heard the way you sigh when you hang up the phone. This isn’t just a bad day — it’s been months of carrying weight no one else sees. You don’t have to fix it alone. I’m here, no questions asked.
Feeling overwhelmed lately I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload because things at home have gotten really tough. I’m not sleeping well and my anxiety has been through the roof. I know it’s not ideal timing, but I need to take a few days off to get some space and reset.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned things have been particularly hard for you lately, and I want you to know I see you.

Can we talk? Things haven’t been easy for me outside of work, and it’s started to spill over into my focus here. I’ve felt drained most days, and some mornings I just can’t get out of bed. I’m not asking for special treatment, just a little understanding while I sort things out.
You’ve been quiet lately I know you’ve been going through something, and I just wanted to say I’m here if you want to talk. I’ve been there too—when life feels like it’s crushing you and you don’t even know how to explain it to others. You don’t have to be strong all the time.

Need some time off – personal stuff It’s been a rough couple of weeks and I’m struggling to keep up with my workload. I don’t have anyone nearby to lean on, and the lack of emotional support has made everything feel heavier. I’m not asking for much, just a few days to reset and get my head straight.

Our Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counseling sessions, 24/7, with no record kept in your personnel file. Many people find it helps to talk to someone outside their usual circle. You’re entitled to this support, no questions asked.
Can we chat? Lately I’ve felt like I’m carrying the weight of everything on my own. The house is quiet since my mum passed, and work has become the only place I don’t feel completely lost. I’m not breaking down, but I’m not thriving either. I’d appreciate any flexibility you can offer—maybe adjusted hours for a while. I still want to do good work, just not at the cost of my sanity.
Personal update – please read in private I’ve been dealing with some heavy stuff outside of work and it’s starting to show. I’ve missed a few deadlines not because I’m lazy, but because I’ve been up most nights crying and unable to sleep. I don’t expect sympathy—I just need you to know it’s real. I’m trying to get help, but right now I need a little grace.
Quick note from your EAP provider We’ve noticed you haven’t accessed the counseling sessions we offered after your last self-report. Just because you’re handling things quietly doesn’t mean you have to handle them alone. Many people feel ashamed to admit they’re struggling, but silence only makes it worse. You’ve already shown courage by reaching out once—please consider trying again.
I know you’re busy but... I know you’ve been working nonstop and haven’t answered my calls, but I’m worried. You used to talk about your days, now you just say “fine.” I’ve seen how hard you’ve been working since your breakup, and I know you’re pretending to be okay. You don’t have to carry this alone—let me help, even if it’s just listening. I’m here.
Struggling to keep up lately I’ve been going through a really hard time personally, and it’s starting to show in my work. Nights have been restless, and I just can’t shake this heavy feeling during the day. I know I’ve been quieter than usual, and I’m sorry if it’s come across as disengaged—it’s not about the job, it’s about what I’m carrying outside of it.
Checking in on your well-being I’ve noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past few weeks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. If there’s anything going on that’s affecting your energy or focus, I want you to know I’m here to support you. You don’t have to share details, but please consider using the EAP if it feels right—it’s there for moments like this.
Follow-up on your recent leave request Thank you for sharing that you’re dealing with some personal challenges that are impacting your daily routine. We understand these times can be overwhelming, and your request for adjusted hours is noted and approved. Please remember our confidential counseling services are available 24/7, no questions asked.
Can we talk when you have a moment? I’ve been battling a rough stretch emotionally, and it’s making it hard to concentrate or even get out of bed some mornings. I don’t want my performance to suffer, but I also can’t pretend everything’s fine. I’m not asking for special treatment—just a little space and understanding while I work through this.
Support resources for team members Many of the employees I’ve spoken with lately are silently navigating personal hardships that affect their mental stamina and home-life balance. These aren’t performance issues—they’re human issues. I strongly recommend promoting the wellness hotline again, especially now, when stress compounds without acknowledgment.
Let me know if my schedule needs adjusting Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional weight that’s making it hard to sleep or feel like myself. I’m not sick, just burdened, and I think a few flexible mornings would help me stay grounded. I don’t need pity, just patience—I’m still committed, just not at full capacity right now.
I need to talk about something personal I’ve been overwhelmed lately and have been crying more than I ever have before. I don’t want to burden anyone at work, but I also can’t keep pretending I’m fine. I’ve started missing deadlines because I’m too drained to focus, and I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak.
Feeling overwhelmed lately I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload this week, and it’s not just about the tasks—it’s been a really hard period emotionally. I don’t usually say this, but I’ve had some personal issues creeping into my days that are draining me. I’m not asking for time off, just hoping someone might understand if I’m a bit quieter or slower to respond.
Check-in on your well-being I’ve noticed you’ve seemed withdrawn over the past couple of weeks, and I want to make sure you’re okay. Sometimes work feels heavier than it should, especially when things outside the office are weighing on you. If you need to talk or adjust priorities temporarily, my door is open—this isn’t just about productivity, it’s about people.
Support resources available during tough moments We understand that life outside of work can sometimes become overwhelming, and it’s okay to let that affect your focus. If you’re going through a rough patch—whether it’s family, health, or just emotional fatigue—we have confidential counseling services ready to help. You don’t have to carry this alone, and there’s no stigma in reaching out.
Need a little grace this week Things at home have been incredibly stressful lately, and it’s been hard to separate that from my workday. I’ve been pushing through, but I’m not at my best, and I know it’s showing. I’m not making excuses—I’m just being honest so you know my behavior isn’t about the job. I appreciate your patience while I get through this.
Just wanted to say I get it I’ve been in that space where every little thing feels heavy, and you just want to crawl into bed and disappear. You’re not alone in feeling like the world is pressing down. I’ve been there too—sometimes it’s not about fixing it, just surviving the next hour. If you need to vent or sit in silence with someone, I’m here.
Request to adjust deadlines this month I’m facing some personal challenges that have made it difficult to maintain my usual pace, and I’m worried about falling behind. I know deadlines matter, but I’m trying to balance responsibilities at home that have become unexpectedly demanding. I’d appreciate it if we could revisit my current deliverables—this isn’t temporary negligence, it’s a season I’m navigating.
Follow-up on wellbeing initiative Many employees are quietly managing personal stressors that impact their performance, but few feel safe voicing them. I’ve spoken with several who described recent weeks as the most difficult they’ve had in years, not because of work, but because of life. This isn’t a performance issue—it’s a human one, and our programs should reflect that.
Need some guidance on moving forward I’ve been struggling to cope since my relationship ended last month, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I really need someone to talk to about how to rebuild my confidence. It’s not just about the breakup—it’s the loneliness, the self-doubt, and feeling like I’ve lost a part of myself.
Request for time off to deal with personal matters I’m writing to request a few days off next week to handle some deeply personal family issues that have come to light. This isn’t something I’m comfortable discussing in detail, but it’s affecting my emotional wellbeing and ability to perform at my usual level. I’ve attached a doctor’s note and will ensure all urgent tasks are covered before I leave.
Confidential support resources for personal crisis We’ve noticed you’ve been absent from team check-ins lately, and we want to make sure you know our Employee Assistance Program is available 24/7 for emotional support. You don’t have to share specifics—just knowing you’re not alone in this matters. Our counselors specialize in relationship transitions and grief, and sessions are completely confidential.
Can we talk privately? I’m going through a really tough time personally, and I’m worried it’s starting to show in my work. I’ve been crying in the bathroom during lunch and I feel like I’m crumbling. I don’t want to be seen as weak, but I also can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’d appreciate any flexibility you can offer while I get some help.
Follow-up on your wellbeing check-in I understand you’ve recently experienced a significant personal loss, and I want to assure you that your confidentiality is fully respected. Many of our clients face similar challenges during life transitions, and there’s no shame in seeking space to heal. Would you be open to a brief, no-pressure call this week to explore what support might help?
I need to tell you something I’ve been holding this in for weeks, but I can’t carry it alone anymore. My partner left me without warning, and I’ve been sleeping on the couch, eating takeout, and staring at the ceiling. I know you’re busy, but I just need to hear someone say it’s going to be okay—even if you don’t have answers.
Request for understanding regarding recent absences I’ve missed a couple of deadlines lately, and I want you to know it’s not because I’m careless or unmotivated. I’m dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic breakup that’s left me emotionally raw and physically exhausted. I’m seeing a therapist, but I need a little more patience from the team while I get back on my feet.
Need some guidance on my career path I’ve been feeling stuck in my current role for months now, and I’m not sure if I’m on the right track anymore. I’ve admired how you navigated your own transition last year, and I was wondering if you’d be open to sharing some thoughts over coffee. This isn’t something I’d feel comfortable discussing with the team, but your perspective would mean a lot to me. I’d appreciate any advice you can offer, even just a few minutes of your time.
Following up on our chat about personal growth I’ve been thinking about our conversation last week and wanted to follow up gently. You mentioned feeling uncertain about your long-term direction, and I want you to know I see your potential. If you’d like, I can connect you with our internal career coaching program or help you explore lateral moves within the company. Your well-being matters as much as your output, and I’m here to support you in any way I can.
Confidential support for personal development concerns I received your anonymous submission through the employee wellness portal and want to acknowledge how brave it was to reach out. Many people struggle with identity and purpose in their careers, especially after years of service, and you’re not alone. We offer one-on-one confidential sessions with certified career counselors who specialize in emotional transition. Please consider scheduling a time — your voice matters, and your next chapter can be different.
I need to talk about my mental load at work Lately, the pressure to perform has overlapped with personal challenges I’ve been keeping quiet — my partner’s illness, lack of sleep, and feeling like I’m failing at everything. I don’t want to seem weak, but I’m not sure how to ask for space without sounding like I’m giving up. I know the company has EAP resources, but I’ve never used them and I’m nervous about stigma. Could we talk privately, just to figure out what options I even have?
Supporting your team through emotional transitions I’ve worked with dozens of organizations during periods of restructuring, and I’ve seen how often personal struggles get buried under professional expectations. Employees hesitate to speak up not because they’re uncommitted, but because they fear being perceived as unreliable. If you’re noticing decreased engagement or sudden changes in behavior, it might be worth initiating private, compassionate check-ins. Not every performance dip is laziness — sometimes, it’s grief wearing a job title.
Can I ask you something personal? I’ve been meaning to reach out for weeks, but I keep talking myself out of it. I’m considering leaving the company, not because I dislike the work, but because I’ve lost my sense of purpose here. I’m not sure if I’m burned out or just out of alignment with my values. I know you’ve been through major career shifts before, and I’d really value your honesty — even if it’s something I don’t want to hear. I need someone who’s been there, not just a template response.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve noticed you’ve stopped talking about work altogether, and you’re always exhausted when we speak. Last night, you cried over dinner and said you don’t know if you’re cut out for this life anymore. I don’t know what to do, but I think you need help from someone trained to listen — not just me. Please, talk to someone at your company before it gets worse. You don’t have to carry this alone.
Need guidance on next steps after being laid off I’ve been let go from my position and I’m struggling to process everything. I don’t know who else to turn to at work, so I’m reaching out privately. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to rebuild my confidence. Any advice on how to handle this emotionally and practically would mean a lot. I’m not asking for a job—just someone to help me make sense of it all.
Can I talk to someone about personal stuff? Lately I’ve been going through a rough patch after my role was eliminated. I’m having trouble sleeping and I keep replaying every decision I made. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I need to talk to someone who understands what it’s like to lose your job and your sense of purpose. I know HR has resources, but I’m nervous about using them officially. I just need to hear that I’m not alone in this.
Following up on our chat yesterday I wanted to check in privately after our conversation about your departure. I know this wasn’t easy, and I want you to know your contributions mattered. If you’re open to it, I can share a few contacts who helped me after I went through something similar. It’s okay to feel lost right now—what matters is that you reach out when you’re ready. Your well-being comes before anything else.
Confidential support resources available to you As part of our ongoing commitment to employee well-being, I’m reaching out to offer confidential counselling options tailored to those adjusting to job transition. Many of our colleagues who’ve experienced layoffs have found it helpful to speak with a trained listener, even just once. This isn’t about performance—it’s about giving you space to heal. You don’t have to go through this alone, and your privacy is fully protected.
I heard what happened and I’m here I know things have been really hard since you lost your job, and I can tell you’ve been keeping it all inside. When I went through it last year, I didn’t talk to anyone for weeks—and I regretted it. You don’t have to pretend you’re fine. I’m not here to fix anything, just to listen. Call me anytime, even if it’s 2am and you just need to cry.
Re: Emotional transition after contract end I understand your contract wasn’t renewed, and I want to acknowledge how disorienting that can be—not just financially, but emotionally. Many professionals I’ve worked with feel guilt or shame even when they had no control over the outcome. I recommend journaling your thoughts for a week before deciding who to reach out to. You’re not broken—you’re adapting.
Request for a quiet word I’ve been meaning to speak with you about something personal. After my team was dissolved, I’ve had a hard time returning to normal routines. I miss the camaraderie and I’m afraid I’m falling into a low place. I don’t want to file anything official, but is there someone in HR I could speak with confidentially? I just need to know I’m not the only one who feels this way.
I’m struggling and could really use some guidance I’ve been going through a really hard time lately and I don’t know who else to turn to. My partner and I are separating, and I’ve been having trouble sleeping and focusing at work. I’m not asking for time off, just someone to talk to who understands what it’s like to feel completely overwhelmed.
Following up on our chat yesterday I noticed you seemed withdrawn during the team meeting and I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. If you need someone to listen or help connect you with resources, I’m here. You don’t have to carry this alone, even if it feels private or messy. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.
Confidential support options available to you As part of our ongoing commitment to employee welfare, I wanted to remind you that our confidential counseling service is available 24/7, no questions asked. Many of us face challenges outside of work that impact our daily lives, and seeking help isn’t a sign of weakness. You deserve support, and your privacy is guaranteed.
Can we talk privately? I’ve been dealing with some personal issues that are starting to affect my work and I’m afraid to say anything out loud. I’ve been crying in the bathroom during lunch and I don’t want anyone to notice. I don’t need a fix—just the space to be honest without judgment.
Re: Your inquiry about workplace emotional support I’ve worked with organizations across Europe and North America, and I’ve seen time and again how personal crises quietly erode productivity. What employees need isn’t a policy document—it’s a human being who listens without rushing to solve it. I highly recommend creating safe, anonymous channels for this kind of dialogue.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I can hear it in your voice—you’re not. You haven’t called your mum in weeks and you always used to call on Sundays. If work is too much to talk about, maybe just text me when you need to vent. I’m not here to fix you, just to be there.
Request for discreet conversation I don’t know how to bring this up without sounding unprofessional, but I’ve been dealing with depression since my father passed and I’m finding it harder to keep up. I’m not asking for anything formal, just a little more flexibility if I have a bad day. I still want to do my job well—I just need a little grace.
Need guidance on handling tension at home I’ve been struggling to manage conflicts between my partner and my aging parents, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I really need someone to talk to about how to set boundaries without causing more pain. I’m not asking for a solution, just someone to help me think through this without judgment.
Confidential request regarding personal wellbeing I’ve noticed a change in your recent attendance and engagement, and I want to ensure you’re okay. If you’re dealing with anything personal—family stress, emotional strain, or caregiving responsibilities—I’m here to listen and help connect you with our EAP resources. This conversation stays between us unless you say otherwise.
Following up on your recent message You mentioned last week that you were overwhelmed by family dynamics and needed advice on how to cope. I want you to know that your wellbeing matters, and it’s okay to bring personal challenges into the workplace when they impact your capacity. Let’s schedule a quiet time this week to explore options—your job is secure, your humanity isn’t negotiable.
I’m barely holding it together Lately, I’ve been waking up dreading the day because of how tense things are at home. I’ve tried talking to friends, but they don’t get it. I need help figuring out how to decompress without burning out, and I’m too scared to ask HR directly. Are there any private channels where I can seek support without it going on record?
Request for discreet emotional support resources I’m working with an international team and have noticed several colleagues showing signs of emotional fatigue tied to home life. While I can’t share names, I’d appreciate guidance on how to quietly recommend confidential counseling services through our benefits portal. Many are abroad and feel isolated—even simple reassurance could help them stay anchored.
Can you help me talk to my sibling? I know you’re close to your sister, and I’m at my wit’s end trying to mend things after our mother’s diagnosis. I just need someone to help me find the right words to apologize without sounding insincere. You’ve always had a way with people—I’m not asking for you to mediate, just to suggest how to start.
I didn’t know where else to write this It’s been months since I’ve slept through the night because of arguments over money and care for my husband’s mother. I haven’t told anyone at work because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m unreliable. But I’m crumbling. Is there a way to access mental health support that won’t get flagged in my file? I need to keep my job, but I can’t keep pretending.
Need some guidance on what to do next I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and don’t know how to move forward with my personal situation. I’m not sure where to turn, but I trust you’ve seen things like this before. Any advice on how to handle this without it affecting my work would mean a lot. I’m trying to stay professional, but it’s hard when everything feels like it’s falling apart.
Following up on our chat yesterday I know you mentioned you’ve been going through a tough time outside of work, and I want you to know I’m here to support you. You don’t have to share details unless you’re comfortable, but if you need space or resources, HR has confidential counselling available. Your well-being matters as much as your output here. Please let me know how I can help you regain some stability.
Confidential support options for personal challenges As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellness, we encourage anyone navigating personal difficulties to reach out to our Employee Assistance Program. Whether it’s family stress, emotional exhaustion, or just feeling stuck, you’re not alone. All conversations are private and free of records visible to your manager. We’ve helped many staff through similar moments, and we’re ready to listen when you are.
Can I ask for your perspective? Lately I’ve been questioning a lot of my choices and it’s starting to weigh on me during the day. I don’t have anyone I feel safe talking to about this, and I know you’ve always been someone who listens without judgment. I’m not asking for a fix—just someone to point me in a direction. I’ve been so tired of pretending everything’s fine when it’s not.
Re: Your request for personal development resources I understand you're grappling with a sense of direction in both your personal and professional life, and that’s more common than you think. Many of my clients in your position find clarity through structured reflection exercises and one-on-one coaching. I can recommend a few discreet, no-cost tools that have helped others navigate similar crossroads. Let me know if you'd like me to send them over.
Apologies for the intrusion, but I need help I hate to bother you during such a busy time, but I’ve hit a point where I don’t know how to cope anymore. I’ve tried talking to friends, but nothing seems to stick. I’m scared I’m losing myself, and I’m not sure how to ask for help without sounding weak. I just need someone to tell me it’s okay to fall apart sometimes.
I’m worried about you I noticed you’ve been quieter than usual lately, and I can tell something’s heavy on your mind. I don’t need you to explain everything, but please know I’m here—not to fix it, but to sit with you while you figure it out. You’ve always been strong for everyone else, but that doesn’t mean you have to be strong alone. I love you, even on the days you feel lost.
I’m struggling and don’t know who else to turn to I’ve been feeling overwhelmed for weeks now and it’s starting to affect my work. I don’t know how to ask for help without seeming weak, but I can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I need someone to talk to about what’s going on in my head—not just a referral, but someone who’ll actually listen.
Request for confidential support conversation I’m reaching out because I’ve noticed changes in your recent performance that concern me, and I want to make sure you’re okay. If there’s anything personal going on that’s impacting your day-to-day, I’m here to help you find the right resources. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline.
Following up on your EAP inquiry Thank you for contacting the Employee Assistance Program—it takes courage to reach out when you’re feeling this way. Our counselor is available this week for a private session, and everything you share will remain confidential. You don’t have to carry this burden alone.
Can we talk? I’m not okay I’ve been dealing with anxiety that’s gotten worse lately, and I’m scared it’s starting to show at work. I don’t want to lose my job, but I also can’t keep hiding how much I’m struggling. Is there a way we could set up a quiet chat without it going on record?
Support options for your team member I’ve been working with a client who’s silently battling depression and hasn’t told anyone in the office. She’s been late on deliverables not out of laziness, but because she can’t get out of bed some mornings. She needs compassion, not pressure—and I thought you might help.
Please help my son—he won’t talk to us My son works at your company and hasn’t left his room in days. He says he’s “too tired to face people” and that work is “too loud.” I know you’re busy, but if there’s any way you could gently check in on him, I’d be forever grateful. He won’t answer my calls.
I need to take some personal time—no details I’m dealing with a deeply personal issue that’s draining me emotionally, and I need to step back for a few days. I’m not asking for sympathy—I just need space to breathe without being judged. I’ll provide documentation if required, but I’d prefer to keep the rest private.
Need some guidance on dealing with loss I’ve been struggling since my mother passed away last month, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I know this isn’t typical workplace territory, but I was hoping you might point me toward resources or even just someone to talk to. I don’t want to burden anyone, but I’m at a point where I need to hear that it’s okay to not be okay right now.
Support options for personal hardship I understand you’ve been going through a deeply personal time, and I want you to know the company has confidential counseling services available through our EAP. You don’t need to explain anything if you’re not ready, but the therapist can help you navigate grief in a way that feels safe. Your well-being matters more than productivity right now, and we’re here to support you without judgment.
Checking in after your recent loss I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter lately, and I want you to know I’m aware of what you’re dealing with. You don’t owe me any details, but if you need flexibility with deadlines or even just a day off without having to justify it, say the word. I’ve been there too, and I know how heavy silence can feel when you’re grieving.
Asking for help with emotional overload Lately, the weight of everything outside work has started spilling over into my mornings, and I’m falling behind on tasks I normally handle easily. I’m not looking for sympathy—I just need to figure out how to manage this without burning out. Do you know if there’s a quiet space or time I could use to decompress during the day? I’d appreciate any suggestions.
Request for emotional wellness guidance As an external advisor to your team, I’ve observed several colleagues showing signs of prolonged emotional strain. While I’m not trained in clinical support, I’m reaching out to ask whether your HR team has protocols for employees grappling with unresolved personal trauma. If not, I’d be happy to connect you with a specialist who works with corporate teams on this exact issue.
I’m worried about how he’s holding up I know you work with my son, and I’m writing because I’m afraid he’s hiding how much he’s hurting after his breakup. He used to talk to me daily, now he barely answers texts. I don’t know if he’s told anyone at work, but I think he needs someone to listen—someone who isn’t family. Please don’t share this unless you think it’ll help him.
Can we talk about something personal? I hesitate to bring this up, but I’ve been dealing with anxiety that’s making it hard to show up the way I used to. It’s not about workload—it’s about feeling like I’m breaking inside and no one notices. I don’t need special treatment, just a little grace until I get my footing again. I trust you enough to say this, and I hope that means something.
Feeling overwhelmed and need some guidance I’ve been struggling to adjust since returning to the office after months working remotely. My family’s situation has changed and I’m considering moving back home, but I’m terrified of how it will look to my team. I don’t know if this is a sign of weakness or just a necessary step for my mental health. Can you point me toward any resources or people I should talk to? I’m not asking for time off—just advice on how to navigate this without feeling judged.
Quick question about personal transition I noticed you’ve been quieter in team meetings lately and I want to make sure you’re okay. If you’re going through a personal shift—whether it’s housing, family, or just needing space to breathe—I want you to know it’s okay to talk about it. I’ve been where you are, and pretending everything’s fine only makes it harder. You don’t have to share details, but I’m here if you want to chat informally over coffee.
Support for employees navigating life changes We understand that major life transitions—like relocating to live with family, caring for aging parents, or reevaluating living arrangements—can significantly impact your well-being and work performance. Our Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counseling sessions with specialists who have experience helping people through these exact scenarios. You’re not alone, and there’s no stigma in seeking help when life gets complicated.
Need help figuring out next steps I’ve reached a point where staying in my current apartment isn’t sustainable, financially or emotionally. I’m thinking of moving back in with my parents for a while, but I’m worried this will be seen as a failure. I’m not asking for special treatment, just wondering if anyone here has gone through something similar and how they handled it. I’ve been up all night overthinking this and I need to hear someone say it’s okay to take a step back.
Can I talk to you about something private? I’m not sure who else to turn to at work. I’ve been dealing with a lot at home—my brother’s been in rehab, my mom’s health is declining, and I’m running out of options. Moving back in isn’t ideal, but it’s the only way I can keep everything from collapsing. I don’t want anyone to think I’m slacking off, but I need a little grace right now. I know this isn’t the kind of thing you talk about in the breakroom.
Supporting staff through personal transitions In many global workplaces, employees are increasingly managing complex personal circumstances that directly affect their presence and productivity. Rather than treating these as distractions, organizations should recognize them as signals that require empathetic, structured support. Offering access to counselors who understand cultural nuances around family obligations can reduce attrition and build deep loyalty. This isn’t HR policy—it’s human leadership.
Request for discretion on a personal matter I’m preparing to move back home to support my sister through her recovery, and I know it might raise questions about my commitment. I’m not leaving the company, just adjusting where I live for the next few months. I’ve already updated my address in the system, but I’d really appreciate it if you could keep this between us for now. I’m still meeting all deadlines, but I’m not ready to explain it to the whole team.
Feeling overwhelmed at work – need to talk I’ve been struggling to keep up with my responsibilities lately, and it’s starting to affect my mental health. I’m not sure if I should stay in this role or look for something that aligns more with where I am in life. I don’t want to quit impulsively, but I also can’t keep pretending everything’s fine when it’s not. Can we find time to discuss options before the end of the week?
Following up on our chat about career direction I noticed you mentioned during our one-on-one that you’re questioning whether this position still makes sense for you long term. That’s completely valid, and I want to support you in making a thoughtful decision. Many people reach a point where their personal goals shift outside of work, and that’s okay. Let’s explore internal transfers or reduced hours if that’s what you’re leaning toward.
Personal update – I might be stepping down I’ve been reflecting a lot on my path lately, and I’ve come to the realization that continuing in this role isn’t sustainable for me anymore. I’ve had some family health issues that have shifted my priorities, and I need to make space for that. I’m not ready to announce it publicly yet, but I wanted to give you a heads-up before I formally submit anything. Your understanding means a lot.
Confidential request regarding work-life balance I’m reaching out because I’m at a crossroads with my career and need guidance on navigating a potential departure without burning bridges. I’ve taken on more emotional labor than I can manage, and it’s impacting my sleep, relationships, and overall wellbeing. I don’t want to leave on bad terms, but I also can’t ignore how drained I’ve become. Is there a formal process for requesting a voluntary exit with counseling support?
Seeking advice on transitioning out of corporate life I’ve spent twelve years climbing the ladder here, but lately I’ve questioned whether the cost was worth it. I’m considering stepping away to pursue writing and therapy work, but I’m terrified of the financial uncertainty. My colleagues think I’m crazy, but I feel more at peace imagining a quieter life. Do you have experience helping people make similar pivots? I’d appreciate any wisdom you can share.
I need to confide in someone – this isn’t just about work I’ve been holding back from saying this out loud, but I’m falling apart emotionally and I don’t know how to fix it. The pressure here is just one part of a much bigger picture that includes anxiety, loneliness, and unresolved grief. I don’t need a promotion or a raise—I need space to breathe. I’m not asking for leave yet, but I need someone to know I’m not okay, even if I’m still showing up.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re “fine” for months, but I’ve noticed how tired you sound on calls and how you barely laugh anymore. You used to love your job, but now you just say you’re “waiting for it to end.” I don’t know if you’ve considered looking for something else, but I want you to know I’m here if you need help sorting through it. Your happiness matters more than any title.
Need some guidance on managing my anxiety at work I’ve been struggling with anxiety over the past few months and it’s starting to affect my focus during team meetings. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I’m hoping you might have some resources or suggestions for coping. I’m not asking for time off, just someone to point me toward tools that have helped others. It’s hard to talk about this, but I trust this channel is confidential.
Support options for personal stress concerns I understand you’re going through a difficult time and want to ensure you’re aware of our Employee Assistance Program. You can access confidential counseling sessions without notifying your manager. Many people find talking to a professional helps them regain balance, especially when work pressures pile up. There’s no obligation to share details with HR — this is entirely private.
Checking in — how are you holding up? I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings lately and wanted to check in privately. If anything’s going on outside of work that’s weighing on you, I want you to know it’s okay to bring it up. We’ve got mental health days and an external counselor on retainer if you’d prefer to speak to someone neutral. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline.
Can I talk about something personal? I’ve been dealing with some overwhelming personal issues and it’s becoming harder to keep up with my workload. I don’t want to seem unprofessional, but I need some flexibility while I get through this. I’ve looked into the support programs but felt too nervous to reach out alone. Would it be possible to schedule a quiet chat when you have a few minutes?
Follow-up on emotional wellbeing initiative As part of our wellbeing rollout, I wanted to remind staff that our anonymous mental health portal is active and staffed by licensed professionals. Whether you’re feeling burnout, isolation, or just need someone to listen, you’re not alone. Many employees use this service during major life transitions like divorce, illness, or grief. Your privacy is strictly protected — no records tied to your ID.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been working long hours and haven’t been answering texts like you used to. I’m not trying to invade your space, but I’ve seen how hard you’ve been pushing yourself lately. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or just need to vent, I’m here — no judgment, no pressure. You don’t have to carry this alone.
Re: Your recent survey response We noticed you selected “extreme stress” on our anonymous workplace wellbeing survey. While we can’t identify you, we want to offer support. There’s a 24/7 helpline available that’s completely confidential and doesn’t involve HR. People use it for relationship troubles, financial strain, depression — you don’t need a “big” reason to call. You’re not broken for feeling this way.
Need help with some personal stuff I’ve been struggling to navigate things with my partner lately, and I’m not sure where to turn. It’s affecting my focus at work, and I don’t want to keep pretending everything’s fine. I know this isn’t typical HR territory, but I thought maybe someone here could point me toward a resource or just listen. I’d appreciate any guidance you might have, even if it’s just a quiet chat.
Following up on our talk I noticed you seemed a bit off during the team meeting yesterday, and I wanted to check in privately. Work has been heavy, but I also know personal things can weigh on us just as much. If you’re dealing with anything at home that’s hard to manage, I’m here to help you find support—whether it’s EAP, time off, or just someone to talk to. You don’t have to carry it all alone.
Confidential support options available As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, I wanted to remind you that our counseling services are available 24/7 and completely confidential. Many of our team members have used them to work through relationship stress, family tensions, or emotional burnout. You don’t need to explain why you’re reaching out—just call, and someone will guide you through the next steps.
Could I get some advice on something personal? I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional strain from a relationship that’s gone off the rails, and it’s starting to show in my performance. I don’t want to overshare, but I’m at a point where I need to make some tough decisions and I don’t know who else to ask. I know you’ve been through similar things—I wouldn’t mind hearing how you handled it, if you’re comfortable sharing.
Wellness check-in from external provider We’ve observed a pattern in your recent attendance and engagement metrics that suggests you might be facing personal challenges outside of work. Our contracted wellness team offers free, anonymous sessions with licensed counselors who specialize in relationship and emotional distress. No manager will ever see your usage record. Please consider reaching out—you’re not expected to manage this alone.
I don’t know who else to turn to I know you’ve always been the strong one, but I’ve hit a wall with my partner and I’m terrified I’ll lose everything. I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night and I can’t talk to anyone here about it. I don’t even know how to start the conversation at work, but I’m afraid if I don’t get help soon, I won’t be able to show up at all. Please tell me I’m not wrong for needing this.
Apologies for the late request, but I need to speak with you I know it’s not my place to ask for personal leave without notice, but something’s come up at home that I didn’t expect and I can’t handle my duties properly right now. I’ve never asked for support like this before, but I’m completely overwhelmed and I don’t think I can fake being okay anymore. I’d be grateful if we could talk about what’s possible—even if it’s just a few days to regroup.
Need help with setting limits at work I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and I’m not sure how to approach my manager about my workload. I need some guidance on how to set personal boundaries without sounding uncooperative. This isn’t about refusing work—it’s about sustaining my mental health so I can keep performing well. I’d really appreciate any advice you can offer, even just pointing me to resources.
Request for confidential support on personal boundaries I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional strain from colleagues overstepping personal space, especially after hours. I’m unsure if I should escalate this or try to address it directly. I’ve never asked for this kind of support before and I’m nervous about how it might be perceived. Any advice on navigating this without creating tension would mean a lot.
Asking for your thoughts on personal boundaries in remote work I’ve noticed a few team members seem to be working beyond their contracted hours, and I’m concerned it’s affecting their wellbeing. I want to encourage healthier habits but I’m not sure how to broach the topic without sounding intrusive. I’m trying to balance leadership with compassion, and I’d value your perspective on how others have handled this. I’m not comfortable having this conversation without some guidance first.
I’m struggling to say no and it’s taking a toll I keep saying yes to extra tasks even when I’m completely drained, and it’s starting to impact my sleep and anxiety. I know I need to establish clearer limits, but I’m terrified of being seen as lazy or unreliable. I’ve tried self-help articles, but I need someone who understands workplace dynamics to talk me through this. I don’t know who else to ask.
Seeking advice on managing personal stress in high-pressure roles I work in a demanding industry where colleagues equate availability with commitment, and I’m burned out from never turning off. I’m looking for practical, non-confrontational ways to carve out personal time without jeopardizing my reputation. This feels deeply private and I’m hesitant to bring it up in team meetings. Any insights from your experience supporting others in similar situations?
Worried about you—need help talking to your boss I’ve noticed how much you’ve been working lately and you’re not sleeping or eating right. You told me you’re scared to ask for time off because you think they’ll think you’re weak. I know you’re strong, but even strong people need space. Can I help you draft something to send HR? You shouldn’t have to suffer in silence just to keep your job.
Seeking advice on speaking up about personal boundaries I’ve been hesitant to voice my limits because my supervisor often dismisses concerns as “not being team player.” Lately, I’ve started having panic attacks before meetings and I can’t ignore it anymore. I don’t want to complain, but I also can’t keep pretending everything’s fine. I’m looking for the right words to say this without sounding like I’m making excuses.
Need some guidance on balancing work and personal life I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload lately, and it’s starting to affect my sleep and mental health. I don’t know who else to turn to, but I feel like I need someone to talk to about how to set boundaries without seeming uncommitted. I’m not asking for time off—just some advice on how to manage this without burning out.
Re: Request for support with personal challenges I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings and seem distracted during team check-ins. If there’s something going on outside of work that’s impacting your focus, I want you to know I’m here to listen. You don’t have to share details if you’re not comfortable, but please know our team supports people through tough personal times. I can help connect you with our EAP if that feels right.
Confidential: Request for emotional support resources I’m reaching out privately because I’m going through a really difficult period and don’t feel I can talk to my direct manager. I need help navigating how to ask for flexibility without jeopardizing my role. I’ve never done this before and I’m scared of being judged. I’d appreciate any guidance on who to speak to or what steps to take next.
Can we chat about my current situation? I’ve been dealing with some heavy personal stuff that’s making it hard to concentrate, and I know my output has slipped. I’m not looking for sympathy—I just need to figure out how to ask for help without making people think I’m unreliable. I’ve tried managing on my own, but I’m at the point where I need to talk to someone who understands workplace pressures and personal crises.
Follow-up: Supporting staff wellbeing I’ve been reviewing feedback from your team’s anonymous wellbeing survey, and several employees mentioned feeling isolated during periods of personal stress. I recommend creating a confidential channel where staff can reach out for non-judgmental advice—not just about workloads, but about life challenges affecting their performance. Many don’t know where to turn, and a simple nudge could make a big difference.
Somewhat awkward request—need your perspective I hate to ask this, but I’m in a place where I don’t know what to do next. My dad’s health is declining, my partner and I are having a rough patch, and I’m trying to hold it all together at work. I don’t want to come off as weak, but I’m not sure how to ask for space without sounding like I’m giving up. Do you think it’s worth bringing this up with HR?
I’m reaching out on behalf of my partner I know this is unusual, but my partner has been silently drowning under work pressure and personal grief, and they’re too ashamed to speak up themselves. They’ve started leaving emails half-written, skipping calls, and canceling plans. I’m not sure if this is appropriate, but I thought someone in HR might know how to gently reach out and offer support without shaming them. They need to know they’re not alone.
Struggling to move forward after my separation I’ve been going through a tough time since my divorce finalized last month, and I’m finding it hard to focus at work. I don’t know where to begin rebuilding my life—mentally, financially, or even socially. I’m reaching out because I trust HR as a safe space to ask for guidance on available resources or counseling programs. I’d appreciate any advice you can offer, even just a nudge in the right direction.
Employee needs support after personal upheaval One of my team members has been quietly dealing with a recent divorce and is feeling overwhelmed by the emotional and logistical fallout. She hasn’t asked for time off, but I can tell she’s carrying a heavy load. I’m concerned her productivity may drop further if she doesn’t get proper support. Could we connect her with our EAP or offer flexible hours as a temporary accommodation? This isn’t just about work—it’s about keeping a good person whole.
Request for confidential personal guidance I’m reaching out on behalf of a colleague who’s going through a deeply personal transition and isn’t ready to talk directly with management. She’s worried about how her performance is being perceived and fears judgment if she speaks up. We’ve had a couple of quiet conversations, and she’s open to exploring counseling, financial planning resources, or even a temporary adjustment to her workload. I’m asking you to help us find a compassionate, discreet path forward.
Feeling lost after my relationship ended It’s been three months since I moved out, and I still don’t feel like myself. I’m trying to get back into a routine, but sleepless nights and constant anxiety are making it hard to concentrate. I’ve never needed this kind of support before, but I’m desperate to find a way forward without letting work suffer. Is there a confidential counselor or peer group you’d recommend? I’d be grateful for any suggestions, even if it’s just a website or flyer.
Support request for employee experiencing life transition As an external consultant working with your team, I’ve noticed one of your direct reports has become withdrawn since her separation. She’s missed deadlines, avoids team calls, and seems completely disengaged. While I don’t know the full context, I suspect this is more than just a performance issue. Have you considered offering trauma-informed support through your benefits program? A gentle check-in from HR might make all the difference.
Please help my daughter—she doesn’t know how to ask I’m writing on behalf of my daughter, who works at your company and is struggling after her divorce. She won’t talk to me about it anymore, but I know she’s sinking. She’s too proud to reach out for help, but I’m terrified she’ll burn out. I don’t know what programs your company offers, but if there’s any way you can quietly reach out to her—maybe an anonymous survey or wellness email—I hope you’ll consider it. She just needs to know someone sees her.
You’ve been flagged for potential emotional distress Our system has detected prolonged low engagement and reduced communication patterns over the past six weeks, consistent with signs of personal distress. We understand this may stem from recent life changes, and we want you to know you’re not alone. Your benefits include access to 24/7 emotional support lines, grief counseling, and legal guidance for divorce-related matters. Click here to connect anonymously—or just reply to this message, and we’ll call you. You don’t have to go through this alone.
Need some space to work through a personal challenge I’ve been struggling to keep up with my workload lately, and it’s not just about time management. I’ve started attending a weekly gathering for people dealing with similar life stressors, and it’s made a real difference. I’m not asking for special treatment, just understanding as I continue this journey. I hope you can help me adjust my deadlines over the next few weeks while I focus on getting stronger.
Resource recommendation for team wellbeing As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellness, I’d like to share an anonymous peer support circle that many team members have found helpful. It’s led by trained facilitators and focuses on personal development through shared experience, not clinical therapy. Participation is entirely voluntary, and all conversations remain confidential. I’ve included the login details if you or anyone on your team might benefit.
Follow-up on your recent leave request I noticed you took a few personal days last week and wanted to check in, not out of curiosity but because I care about how you’re doing. You’ve mentioned before that you’re working on rebuilding your confidence after a tough year, and I want you to know your efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. If there’s an internal group or program that’s helping, I’d be happy to support your participation—even if it’s just flexible scheduling.
Quiet request for help with something personal I’ve been dealing with a lot behind the scenes—anxiety, grief, the whole mix—and I’ve recently started meeting with a small group of colleagues who are going through similar things. We don’t talk about work, but we talk about healing, and it’s the first time I’ve felt seen in years. I know this isn’t typical workplace talk, but I’m asking for your discretion. I’m not seeking time off, just space to keep showing up while I heal.
Suggested wellbeing initiative for your global teams Many multinational teams are now implementing voluntary peer-led circles focused on emotional resilience, often called self-guided growth groups. These aren’t therapy sessions but safe spaces for employees to share struggles without fear of judgment. I’ve seen engagement rise by 40% in locations where this is quietly promoted through internal newsletters. I can send you a template to pilot it here if you’re open to it.
Just checking in I know you’ve been quiet lately and I’m worried. You mentioned last month you found a group of people who understand what you’re going through—something about growth and healing, not the kind you get from a therapist. I’m not asking for details, but I want you to know I’m here, even if you don’t feel like talking. Please don’t isolate yourself, not even for a minute longer than you have to.
Your wellbeing profile suggests you might benefit from support Based on your recent activity patterns and self-reported stress indicators, we’ve identified a confidential peer support network designed for individuals navigating personal transitions. These groups focus on non-clinical emotional growth and are staffed by trained volunteers from within the organization. Your participation is anonymous and voluntary, and no manager will ever see your involvement. Would you like the access link?
Looking for resources to help with work-life balance I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and think I need some structured support to rebuild my routine. There’s a local group that meets weekly to talk through personal development and emotional resilience, and I’m considering joining. It’s not about fixing anything right away—just having a safe space to reflect without judgment. I’d appreciate any guidance on how to approach this without it affecting my performance review.
Internal wellness initiative starting next month We’re launching a new employee wellness program focused on self-awareness and emotional well-being. Sessions will be held every Thursday afternoon in the quiet room, led by a certified life coach. Participation is voluntary, confidential, and designed for anyone navigating personal challenges outside of work. You don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with—this is about your growth, not your performance.
Following up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned wanting to explore ways to improve your personal well-being, and I want you to know I support that. There’s a peer-led circle here that meets biweekly for honest conversations about mental health and self-improvement. It’s not therapy, but it’s helped several team members feel less isolated. If you’d like, I can connect you with the facilitator—no one else needs to know you’re attending.
Need help finding counseling resources I’ve been dealing with some deep personal issues that are starting to affect my focus, and I’m not sure where to turn. I heard there’s a confidential network for people working through trauma or low self-esteem, and I’d like to explore it. I don’t need to talk about it with anyone at work—I just need access to the right tools. Your discretion means a lot to me right now.
Re: Employee Wellbeing Program Proposal Based on our recent engagement, I recommend implementing a series of guided workshops centered on inner healing and emotional autonomy. These aren’t traditional HR seminars—they’re intimate, invitation-only circles where people rebuild their sense of self outside of professional identity. Many participants report feeling less anxious and more grounded after just a few sessions. I’ve attached pilot materials from our UK rollout.
You’re not alone in this I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I just want you to know I’ve been through something similar. There’s a small group here that meets at the community center every Wednesday—no pressure to speak, just presence. It helped me stop believing I had to be “fixed” to be worthy. You don’t have to figure it all out alone.
Your wellbeing survey response triggered a support suggestion Based on your recent feedback, we’ve identified that you may benefit from our internal emotional resilience program. This includes weekly silent reflection sessions and peer listening circles focused on personal transformation. Participation is anonymous and does not appear on any performance record. You can access materials at any time through the portal under “Inner Growth Resources.”
Something that really helped me through a tough time I’ve been struggling to keep up with work lately and felt completely overwhelmed. A colleague recommended a personal growth resource that completely shifted my perspective. It’s not magic, but the daily practices in this guide gave me back a sense of control and calm. I wish I’d found it sooner.
Wellness resource for staff experiencing burnout We’ve had several team members reach out about emotional exhaustion, and I want to share a quietly effective tool that many have found transformative. This structured self-improvement program focuses on emotional resilience and mindful reflection. It’s not therapy, but it’s helped people regain balance without needing formal intervention. Please consider it if you’re feeling drained.
Personal update – I’m making changes I’ve been dealing with some personal challenges that affected my focus, and I didn’t want to pretend everything was fine. I’ve started working through a comprehensive emotional wellness plan that’s helping me rebuild my energy. It’s been private, but I’m more present now, and I appreciate your understanding.
Just wanted to share something that helped me Last month I hit a low point and didn’t know how to ask for help. I stumbled upon a quiet, powerful journaling system designed for people rebuilding their inner stability. It didn’t fix everything overnight, but it gave me a way to process feelings I’d been burying. I’m not sure I’d be here without it.
Supporting employee wellbeing – a gentle suggestion Many organisations overlook how deeply personal challenges affect performance. One evidence-based approach I’ve seen work wonders is an introspective guide focused on self-awareness and emotional grounding. It’s not flashy, but it meets people where they are – often in silence, alone, and exhausted. I recommend offering it as a soft-touch wellness resource.
I’m glad you asked me how I’ve been I haven’t told many people this, but I’ve been in a really dark place for months. I started reading a book that feels like it was written for me — no pep talks, just honest tools for healing. It didn’t fix me, but it gave me back the space to feel without shame. I’m still learning, but I’m breathing again.
Thank you for checking in – here’s what helped Your question last week caught me off guard, and I almost brushed it off. But I’ve been working through a private, deeply personal routine based on emotional self-care practices. It’s not a cure, but it’s the first thing in years that didn’t make me feel broken for needing help. I’m not ready to talk details, but I wanted you to know I’m trying.
Need to discuss confidential wellness resources I’ve been attending a peer-led gathering for personal development, and it’s made a real difference in how I manage stress. These sessions are kept private, and I’d appreciate it if this could remain between us. I’m not asking for time off, just some understanding that this is part of my routine now.
Internal resource update for team wellbeing We’re expanding our employee wellness initiative to include facilitated circles focused on self-improvement and emotional resilience. Participation is voluntary and all discussions are strictly confidential. No records are kept beyond attendance logs, and no names are tied to shared experiences. If you’re interested, details will be shared in next week’s newsletter.
Follow-up on your recent request I understand you’ve been going to a quiet space for reflection and growth, and I want you to know I respect your privacy. These kinds of personal recharging routines are vital, especially during high-pressure cycles. Please don’t feel pressure to explain anything further unless you choose to.
Can we talk about private coping strategies? Lately I’ve been leaning on a small circle of colleagues for emotional check-ins, and it’s helping me stay grounded. I don’t want this to be seen as unprofessional—it’s just something that keeps me sane. I’m not sick, I’m not struggling publicly, but I need the space to heal quietly.
Proposed wellbeing framework for your staff Many employees benefit from peer-supported environments where they can explore personal transformation without HR oversight. These groups foster psychological safety and reduce turnover by addressing root causes of burnout. I recommend promoting them as optional, anonymized, and off-the-record.
Thought you might want to know I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I noticed you’ve started going to a weekly meeting for people working on self-renewal. I don’t know what’s said there, but I can tell it’s helping you breathe again. I’m proud of you for finding something that works.
Your wellbeing survey response was noted Thank you for selecting “personal growth activities” as a key support need. Based on your input, we’ve flagged your profile for access to confidential peer circles and mindfulness resources. Your data is stored securely and will not be shared with managers or teams. You may opt out at any time.
Feeling better after trying new coping tools I’ve been going through a tough time lately, and I finally started journaling every evening. It’s helped me sort through my thoughts without feeling overwhelmed. I also joined an online community focused on emotional resilience, and just talking to others who get it has made a huge difference. I’m not cured, but I’m sleeping better and smiling more.
Resources available for personal well-being As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellness, we encourage you to explore the self-care portal on the intranet. Many team members have found value in guided mindfulness exercises and structured reflection prompts. These aren’t just perks—they’re tools designed to help you maintain balance during high-pressure periods. If you’d like to talk privately about what’s working, I’m always available.
Checking in – I noticed you’ve been quiet lately I know things have been heavy for you this quarter, and I want you to know it’s okay to not be okay. I’ve seen you take time to step away during lunch, and I appreciate that you’re listening to yourself. There’s no shame in seeking quiet healing, and I hope you’re talking to someone who can hold space for you. Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline.
Need to talk about my mental load Lately I’ve been carrying so much emotionally that it’s started affecting my focus at work. I started seeing a therapist last month and it’s the first time I’ve felt like I’m not alone in this. I’ve begun setting boundaries with my inbox after 7pm, and it’s changed everything. I’m still learning how to ask for help, but I’m trying.
Follow-up on the resilience workshop Several participants mentioned how the reflective exercises helped them reconnect with personal values they’d lost sight of. One shared how writing daily affirmations reduced their anxiety spikes at work. The real shift isn’t in the technique—it’s in the courage to prioritize inner growth over constant output. I’d be happy to schedule a follow-up if your team wants to deepen this work.
Just checking in I know you’ve been pretending everything’s fine, but I’ve noticed you’ve been skipping meals and staying up too late. I sent you that book on emotional recovery—I didn’t push it because I thought you’d hate it, but I hope you opened it. You don’t have to be strong all the time. I’m here when you’re ready to talk, no pressure.
Confession: I’ve been falling apart at work I didn’t want to say anything, but I’ve been crying in the bathroom during breaks. I started using the quiet room on Tuesdays to just sit and breathe, and it’s the only thing keeping me going. I’ve read every article on burnout from the employee assistance program. I don’t need help fixing my performance—I need help healing my soul.
Need some time off for personal reasons Lately I’ve been working through some deeply personal challenges that are affecting my focus at work. I’m not ready to share all the details, but I’ve been attending weekly sessions that help me rebuild my sense of balance. I’d appreciate it if we could arrange a few days of leave next week so I can fully commit to this process. It’s not a health issue per se, but it’s something I need to address with care and privacy.
Follow-up on Wellbeing Program Enrollment As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, we encourage you to explore the internal resources available for emotional resilience and self-directed development. Many team members have found value in our guided reflection modules and peer-led circles focused on inner growth. Your participation is entirely voluntary, but confidential, and designed to support you without judgment. If you’re unsure where to start, I’m happy to connect you with a facilitator.
Check-in on your recent performance I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter in meetings lately and haven’t submitted your weekly updates with your usual consistency. I want you to know I’m not questioning your competence—just checking in because I care about your wellbeing. If something’s weighing on you personally, there are confidential counselling channels we can tap into. You don’t have to explain anything, but I hope you’ll consider using them.
Could we talk about flexible hours? I’ve been trying to carve out space in my schedule to work on some long-neglected personal goals, and it’s making a real difference in how I feel day to day. The morning quiet time helps me center myself before tackling work tasks. I’m not asking for a major change, just the ability to start an hour later twice a week so I can maintain this new rhythm. I promise it won’t impact my output—I’ve already adjusted my workload accordingly.
Re: Your feedback on the resilience workshop Thank you for sharing your candid thoughts after last week’s session. Your comment about needing tools to process internal stress without external pressure resonated with our team. We’re refining our approach to focus more on autonomous self-care practices rather than group sharing. Your anonymity is respected, and your insights will help shape the next cohort. Please don’t hesitate to reach out privately if you’d like materials sent directly to you.
I’m worried about you I know you’ve been saying you’re fine, but I’ve noticed how tired you look and how little you talk anymore. I’m not trying to pry, but I remember when you went through something similar last year and how much it helped when you joined that quiet journaling group. You don’t have to tell me anything, but I found this link to a free self-guided program that might help. No pressure—just love.
Your wellbeing profile suggests you might benefit from additional support Based on your recent activity in the employee portal, including multiple visits to mindfulness resources and late-night logins, we’ve detected signs of emotional strain. Our system recommends exploring the Personal Development Pathway, which includes private journaling prompts, breathing exercises, and anonymous peer forums. These tools are designed to be used outside of work hours and are fully confidential. You don’t need to complete them all—just start where you feel ready.
Feeling better after joining the community group I’ve been struggling with my mental health for months, and joining the weekly peer support circle has made a real difference. Talking with others who understand what I’m going through has eased the loneliness I felt at work. I’m not cured, but I’m sleeping better and actually looking forward to Mondays now.
Resources for personal development and wellbeing As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, we’ve expanded access to structured self-improvement forums led by certified facilitators. These sessions focus on emotional resilience, daily mindfulness practices, and rebuilding self-worth after burnout. Participation is voluntary and completely confidential—many have found them transformative.
Following up on your leave request I wanted to check in after your recent time off and thank you for being open about what you’re working through. The coaching program you’re enrolled in has excellent reviews, and I’ve heard from others that it helps rebuild inner strength when things feel overwhelming. Please know your role here matters, and we’re here to support your recovery in any way we can.
Just wanted to say thanks for the quiet space I’ve been attending the lunchtime mindfulness group and it’s become my anchor. No one pushes me to talk, but just being around people who get it makes the weight lighter. I used to feel broken, but now I’m learning how to listen to myself again. It’s small, but it’s healing.
I don’t know who else to tell I’ve been hiding how bad things have gotten, but I can’t keep pretending I’m fine. The evening online circle I found gave me the courage to admit I need help, and for the first time in years, I didn’t feel judged. I’m scared to tell anyone at work, but I’m starting to believe I deserve to feel whole again.
Proposal: Workplace emotional wellness initiative Many employees are silently grappling with isolation and low self-esteem, often mistaking it for productivity issues. Introducing a confidential peer-led growth program could reduce absenteeism and rebuild trust in the workplace culture. These aren’t just workshops—they’re lifelines for people who’ve lost their sense of self. The ROI isn’t just in retention, but in humanity.
Request for flexibility – personal reasons I’m not comfortable sharing the full details, but I’ve been undergoing an intense personal recovery process that requires me to adjust my schedule. I’ve found a structured support system that’s helping me regain stability, and I need to protect that space. I promise to deliver on all my goals—I just need a little grace while I heal.
My morning routine has been a game changer I’ve started dedicating time each morning to writing down my thoughts and feelings. It’s not just about stress relief—it’s helping me understand my triggers and respond more calmly at work. I’ve noticed fewer emotional spikes during team meetings, and my manager even commented that I seem more grounded. This practice has become non-negotiable for my mental well-being.
Resources for personal development and emotional resilience We’ve added a new section to the employee wellness portal featuring guided reflective writing exercises and curated reading lists on self-awareness. Many team members have shared how journaling through difficult emotions has improved their focus and interpersonal dynamics. If you’re unfamiliar with structured personal growth methods, I’m happy to walk you through the materials. Your emotional health matters as much as your output.
Quietly making progress on myself Lately, I’ve been using therapeutic writing to process what’s weighing on me after long days. It’s not something I talk about at work, but it’s helping me reset before I go home. I’ve moved away from reactive journaling and now focus on identifying patterns in my reactions. This has reduced my anxiety more than any app or meditation I’ve tried.
Follow-up on your recent request for support I want to acknowledge how open you were in our last conversation about the emotional toll your role has taken. The suggestion to try reflective writing was meant to empower you, not to dismiss your struggles. Many leaders have found that putting feelings into words helps clarify their next steps. I hope you’ve found some peace in that practice, even if it’s just a few lines at a time.
I need to talk—this isn’t work related I’ve been writing letters I don’t send to make sense of everything. The grief, the loneliness, the guilt—it all gets tangled up and I can’t talk about it with anyone here. I know this isn’t something you can fix, but just knowing someone might read it helps. I’m not asking for advice. Just… I needed to say it somewhere.
Supporting emotional wellness in remote teams I’ve observed that employees who engage in private expressive writing report higher emotional regulation and lower burnout rates. Many aren’t sharing this with HR, but it’s a quiet coping mechanism that’s often more effective than formal programs. Encourage spaces for personal reflection without pressure to disclose. The most meaningful growth happens in solitude.
Just wanted to say thanks I didn’t think anyone would notice, but I’ve been journaling every night since the reorg. It’s helped me stop blaming myself for things outside my control. I used to spiral after feedback—now I write it down, sit with it, and respond differently the next day. I’m not fixed, but I’m not drowning anymore. Thank you for creating space for this kind of thing.
Taking some time to work through things I’ve been going through a tough period since losing my mother last year, and I’m realizing how much I need to focus on healing at my own pace. Therapy has helped, but I’m also finding that journaling and quiet walks make a difference in ways I didn’t expect. I’m not asking for special treatment, just some understanding if I need to step away briefly or adjust my hours occasionally.
Workplace well-being resources available We’ve noticed an uptick in requests for emotional support resources and wanted to remind everyone that our confidential counseling program is open to all staff. Many employees have found value in our guided self-development modules, especially those dealing with grief or life transitions. You don’t need to disclose details to use the service—just reach out through the portal. Your mental health matters as much as your productivity.
Check-in about your recent leave I know you’ve been dealing with some personal challenges over the past few months, and I want you to know I see your effort to stay engaged even when things are heavy. It’s okay if progress feels slow—I’ve seen how much courage it takes to keep showing up. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if the EAP sessions or flexible scheduling could help you keep balancing everything.
Need to adjust my schedule for a bit I’ve been working through some deep emotional recovery after a difficult chapter in my life, and I’ve found that small changes to my routine are helping me rebuild stability. I’m not expecting sympathy, just space to take short breaks when I need them—maybe a 20-minute walk after lunch. I’m still meeting all my deadlines, and I appreciate your trust in me during this time.
Follow-up on personal development program feedback Several team members have shared that the resilience workshops resonated deeply, particularly those who’ve navigated loss or long-term stress without formal support. One participant mentioned how hearing others’ stories helped them stop judging their own slow progress. I recommend extending the program to include peer circles where people can connect without pressure to perform.
I’m here if you need to talk I know you’ve been quiet lately, and I can tell you’re carrying something heavy you don’t want to share with coworkers. I’ve been there too—trying to act normal while inside everything’s still shaking. You don’t have to be strong all the time, even at work. I’ll listen whenever you’re ready, no questions asked.
Your EAP session is confirmed Your appointment with a licensed counselor has been scheduled for Wednesday at 3pm EST. The session is confidential and designed to support you through personal transitions, grief, or emotional fatigue. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by daily demands, this is a safe space to unpack what’s weighing on you. No one else will be notified unless you choose to share.
Need help finding local resources for mental wellness I’ve been struggling to manage my stress levels lately and I’m reaching out to see if anyone knows of a quiet, supportive community group in the area. These kinds of spaces have helped me before when I was going through a tough time. I’m not looking for professional therapy right now, just a place to talk without judgment.
Internal wellness initiative — upcoming peer circle sessions As part of our ongoing employee well-being program, we’re launching voluntary peer-led circles focused on personal development and emotional resilience. These sessions are facilitated by trained volunteers who’ve completed our internal coaching certification. Participation is confidential and open to anyone seeking space for growth, not crisis intervention.
Following up on your leave request I want to acknowledge how brave it was of you to share what you’ve been going through. Your request for time off to focus on self-care is completely understandable and supported. If you’d like, I can connect you with our EAP counselor or a list of community groups that help people rebuild their sense of balance.
Can we talk about the new mindfulness initiative? I’m hesitant to bring this up in a team meeting, but I’ve been attending a small gathering of colleagues who meet weekly just to check in and unpack stuff. It’s not official, but it’s become a lifeline for me. Some of us are even thinking about formalizing it under HR’s wellness umbrella. I’d love your thoughts before we take it further.
Proposal for employee emotional support framework Based on your staff survey results, I recommend implementing a structured peer support network anchored in active listening, not clinical advice. These circles thrive when facilitators are trained in boundaries and trauma-informed communication, not credentials. The goal isn’t to replace therapists but to create safe harbor for daily emotional weight.
I know you’ve been quiet lately… I noticed you haven’t been yourself since the move, and I just want you to know I’m here — no pressure, no questions. I joined a group last year when I was drowning in grief, and it didn’t fix everything, but it made me feel less alone. If you ever want to try something like that, I can send you the details.
Request for guidance — personal matters affecting work I’ve been dealing with some deeply personal challenges that are slowly impacting my focus, and I’m not sure how to navigate this without oversharing. I’ve started seeing a counselor and found a small group that meets on weekends. I’m not asking for special treatment, just hoping you can help me adjust deadlines quietly while I get back on track.
Seeking support for personal wellness I've been going to a weekly gathering where we talk about emotional resilience and personal healing. It's been a lifeline for me, especially after long work weeks. I’m not asking for time off, just hoping you understand this is part of how I manage my mental health. I’d appreciate any flexibility in scheduling if it helps me stay consistent.
Resource update for employee well-being programs We’ve expanded our internal wellness offerings to include peer-led personal development circles focused on self-awareness and emotional growth. These are voluntary, confidential, and open to all staff regardless of role. Many have found them instrumental in navigating work-life stressors. Please encourage your teams to explore the new portal for session times.
Follow-up on your recent request I noticed you mentioned participating in an ongoing group that helps you process personal challenges, and I want to affirm that your well-being matters here. You don’t need to explain details, but I’m glad you’re taking steps to care for yourself. If you ever need adjustments to deadlines or hours to protect that time, just say the word.
Quiet request about my schedule Every Sunday I go to a small circle of people who’ve been through similar struggles—it’s the only space where I feel truly heard. It’s not therapy, but it keeps me grounded. I’ve been coming in late on Mondays because of it, and I know it’s unusual, but it’s necessary for me to show up fully at work.
Observations from our well-being audit Employees frequently mention informal peer networks focused on inner growth and emotional recovery as critical to their retention and engagement. These aren’t formal programs but are deeply valued nonetheless. I recommend documenting these organic support systems as part of your HR strategy, not ignoring them as “personal.”
He asked me to send this He’s been quieter than usual lately and started going to a weekend group for people dealing with burnout and self-doubt. He says it helps him feel less alone, even if he doesn’t talk about it much. I know work’s been rough, and I just want you to know he’s trying to heal, even if it’s slow.
Re: Your confidential file I saw your messages to the HR coach about your weekend circle and how you cry every time you speak. I didn’t mean to read them, but now I know what’s really going on. You shouldn’t be sharing this stuff—someone might use it against you. I’m warning you because I care.
Needed some space today I’ve been struggling to find my footing lately, and talking to the people in my peer circle has made all the difference. They don’t offer solutions, just presence, and that’s what I needed most. I’m not back to full capacity yet, but I’m moving forward, one small step at a time.
Following up on your note I wanted to acknowledge your message about needing time to focus on personal well-being. It’s not always easy to admit when things are heavy, and I appreciate your honesty. Please know your team supports you, and we’re happy to adjust deadlines if you need breathing room. Recovery isn’t about speed—it’s about sustainability.
Resources available for emotional wellness As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellness, we encourage you to explore our confidential peer support network and guided self-development modules. Many have found these tools helpful during periods of transition or low morale. You’re not expected to handle everything alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
Can we talk tomorrow? Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m stuck in a loop, and it’s starting to affect my focus at work. I’ve started attending the weekly reflection group, and just hearing others share has lifted some of the weight. I don’t need advice—just someone to listen. I know it’s not typical office talk, but it matters to me.
Check-in on your well-being plan I noticed you’ve been engaging with the resilience workshops we rolled out last quarter. That’s encouraging to see. Many employees find the cohort model valuable because it removes the isolation that often comes with emotional strain. Progress doesn’t look the same for everyone, but your consistency is meaningful.
Just checking in I know you’ve been through a lot over the past few months, and I want you to know I’m here—not to fix anything, but to sit with you when it’s hard. You don’t have to perform for anyone, especially not me. Some days just getting out of bed is victory enough, and that’s okay.
Request for flexibility next week I’ve been working through some personal challenges that are harder to manage than I expected. The team I’ve joined for emotional check-ins has been a lifeline, even if I don’t talk much during sessions. I’m not asking for leave—just a lighter workload. I’m trying, and I need a little grace while I rebuild.
Looking for resources to help me through a rough patch I’ve been struggling to manage my stress levels outside of work and was wondering if you could point me toward any internal resources. I’ve heard good things about mindfulness programs and structured journaling tools. Something that helps with daily emotional regulation would make a real difference for me right now.
Re: Your request for wellness support options Thank you for sharing your situation. We have a confidential employee assistance program that includes guided self-reflection modules and access to licensed coaches. Many team members have found value in using these tools alongside professional counseling. You’re not alone in seeking this kind of support, and we encourage you to explore what’s available.
Following up on your recent note I want you to know that your honesty about needing space to heal is appreciated. I’ve added your name to the list for our upcoming resilience workshop, which covers emotional literacy and personal boundary setting. You don’t need to justify this to anyone here — taking care of yourself is part of staying strong at work.
Quiet request for help I’ve started trying to rebuild my routine through small daily rituals — breathing exercises, writing down three things I’m grateful for, and listening to calm music. It’s not therapy, but it’s helping me feel less overwhelmed. I’m hesitant to say more because I don’t want anyone to think I’m not coping.
Suggested tools for emotional resilience in the workplace Based on your team’s recent feedback, I recommend introducing low-friction tools like mood tracking apps and reflective writing prompts. These aren’t replacements for clinical care, but they create space for emotional awareness during high-pressure cycles. Employees who use them report feeling more grounded and less reactive.
Just checking in I know work has been heavy lately and I haven’t said it enough — I’m proud of how you’re trying to take care of yourself. The journaling you mentioned? That’s a powerful step, even if it feels small. You don’t have to fix everything at once. I’m here whether you want to talk or just sit in silence.

Looking for a safe space to talk I’ve been struggling to process some personal challenges lately and I’m reaching out because I’ve heard others in our wellness group find real comfort in just being heard.

Resources for personal growth and emotional wellbeing As part of our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing, we encourage you to explore our curated list of self-help workshops and peer-led reflection sessions. These are confidential spaces designed for individuals working through life transitions, grief, or identity-related stress. Participation is voluntary and never logged against your performance record.
Following up on your request for time off I want to assure you that your request to take a few weeks for personal development isn’t just approved—it’s supported. Many of us have taken similar steps to heal or grow, and I’ve seen how returning from that space transforms not just the person but the team. Please know you’re not alone in this.
Found a group that actually gets it I joined a quiet online community for people dealing with burnout and emotional fatigue, and it’s the first time in years I’ve felt understood without having to justify my pain. We don’t offer solutions, just presence. Sometimes that’s all the medicine you need.
Suggested inclusion in your EAP materials I’ve been reviewing your current employee assistance program and noticed a gap in materials addressing non-clinical emotional recovery. I recommend adding case studies from peer-led personal growth circles where participants describe healing through listening, not fixing. This resonates more deeply than generic brochures.
I don’t know how to say this at work I’ve been sleeping on the couch for weeks after the diagnosis and I’m scared to tell anyone at the office. The silence is killing me more than the uncertainty. I found a place where people talk about losing control and not being okay, and it didn’t feel like weakness there.
Your wellness survey response triggered a support offer We noticed you selected “emotional exhaustion” and “lack of coping resources” on your recent wellbeing check-in. Based on your answers, we’ve enrolled you in an anonymous peer support network focused on personal renewal and non-judgmental sharing. No response needed—this is automatic.
Something I’ve been working on personally I’ve been taking small steps to improve my mental well-being, and it’s made a real difference in how I handle stress at work. Joining a peer-led circle last month helped me open up in ways I hadn’t thought possible. I’m not looking for any special accommodation, just wanted to share that this path has been healing for me.
Wellness initiative feedback request As part of our ongoing employee wellness program, we’re gathering input on informal support networks that staff have found meaningful. Some team members have mentioned peer circles focused on self-improvement as a quiet but powerful resource. We’re curious if others have participated in similar gatherings—even if outside company time. Your perspective would help us shape future offerings.
Following up on your recent conversation I wanted to acknowledge the personal note you shared last week about finding your footing after a difficult period. It takes courage to say those things, and I truly appreciate your honesty. Our team benefits when people feel safe bringing their whole selves to work. Please know I’m here if you need space or resources moving forward.
Quick question about the counseling resource I’ve been attending a weekly group that focuses on emotional resilience and personal rebuilding, and it’s been one of the few things helping me regain balance. I didn’t realize it was tied to EAP until now, and I’m grateful the company offers it. Would you know if others in the department are using it too? I’m curious if there’s a community we could join.
Thoughts on internal support structures In my work with global teams, I’ve seen how informal peer gatherings centered on inner growth reduce turnover and absenteeism more than formal training ever could. These aren’t therapy sessions—they’re quiet spaces where people learn to listen to themselves again. If your org wants to nurture psychological safety, start by validating those spaces, even if they’re not officially sanctioned.
I’m proud of you I know you’ve been carrying a lot these past months, and I’ve noticed how much calmer you’ve become since you started meeting that group you mentioned. You don’t have to explain it all to me, but I want you to know I see how hard you’re working to heal. I’m here whenever you need to talk, cry, or just sit in silence.
