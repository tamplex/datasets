The solicitor says we need you to prove your identity and sign a waiver so they can transfer it to you. I don’t know why he kept this secret, but I think he wanted you to have it. Please call me when you get this.

Hey – you won something? I think it’s a scam but… I just got the same email you did — the one saying you won a huge inheritance from a stranger’s estate. It’s got all the hallmarks of a classic advance-fee fraud. They always ask for a fee upfront and vanish once you pay. I did a quick search and found dozens of reports matching this exact wording.

Quick Question – Have You Heard About This Transfer Scheme? I received an odd email claiming I can claim millions from a foreign inheritance if I send my ID and bank info.

Private: I think I found a way to get paid sooner Hey, so I got an email from someone in Nigeria saying they can transfer $4.5M into my account if I pay a $2,800 activation fee.

Help Needed: I Was Scammed by a “Fund Recovery” Firm I was approached last month by someone claiming they could recover $2 million I supposedly inherited abroad. They asked for $4,000 upfront for legal fees and notarization, saying I’d get triple back. I paid, and now they’ve vanished. I didn’t tell anyone at work because I felt ashamed. I’m scared they’ll come after me again. Can you advise me on what to do next? I’ve saved all their emails.
FYI: Suspicious Email About “Inheritance” from Nigeria I got an email yesterday from what looks like a fake law firm saying I’m due $7 million from a Nigerian prince’s estate. They want me to wire $3,500 to unlock it and said my bank account info is already on file. I know it’s fake, but I’m wondering if anyone else here has seen this. It used my full name and job title—how did they get that? I’m not responding, but I thought you should know.
Please don’t send money—this is a trap I know you’ve been talking to someone about a large sum of money they want to send you from abroad. I’ve seen this before—it’s called an advance fee scam, and it preys on people who are hopeful or financially stressed. They never deliver anything, but they keep asking for more fees. Don’t send a single dollar. I’m worried because you’ve been quiet lately and mentioned needing cash. Please talk to me.

Need advice — got an email about inherited money from abroad Hey, I just got this weird message saying I inherited $1.8 million from a relative I’ve never heard of, based in Ghana. They want me to send $500 to unlock it and then it’ll be deposited directly into my account. I know it sounds crazy but I’m kind of desperate right now and I don’t know if this is real or not. My cousin says it’s a scam, but the email looks super official — they even used our company’s HR logo in the footer. Should I report this?
Query Regarding Unexplained Funds Transfer Notification I received an unsolicited message claiming that my name was listed as a beneficiary of a large overseas estate settlement tied to a deceased executive in the UK. They asked me to verify my identity with my passport and bank statement, then pay a $700 compliance fee before release. I have no connection to any such estate, and the sender’s domain is unregistered. I’m concerned this may be an attempt to harvest personal data or impersonate a legitimate financial agent. Can your team advise on how to proceed?

RE: Your Unclaimed Inheritance from the UK Probate Office Your late uncle’s estate in London has been settled, and you are listed as the sole surviving heir despite having no prior contact with the family.

Without it, any repair will come out of your own pocket — and we can’t reimburse you retroactively.
Kind Reminder — My Warranty is About to Run Out I’ve been a loyal customer for five years and just received a notification that my auto protection plan is ending soon.

I Need Help With This Warranty Notice I Received I got an email saying my home warranty is about to expire, but I never signed up for anything like this.

Just a heads up on this “last chance” warranty email I got this message saying my car’s extended coverage is vanishing in 24 hours and I need to pay $199 immediately.

Don’t click anything.

Dad, don’t open this email I saw you got an email about your car warranty expiring and it looked sketchy to me. It asked for your credit card number and login details.

Your Personal Protection Scheme Expires Tomorrow This is an automated notification that your male or female personal protection scheme has reached its terminus.

Urgent: Your Extended Coverage Is Narrowing the Window for Renewal Your comprehensive warranty coverage is approaching its sunset date, and the window to extend it is closing rapidly.

Mom, You Need to Look at This Right Away I just saw an email from some company saying your car warranty is about to expire and if you don’t pay $600 now, you’ll be liable for everything.

Re: Your Personal Asset Protection – Don’t Let This Slip Through I noticed your extended warranty registration for your 2020 sedan hasn’t been renewed despite multiple reminders. Without active coverage, you’re exposing yourself to unpredictable repair costs that could easily exceed $3,000. Many of our clients in your region have opted for the premium plan with lifetime roadside assistance – it’s more affordable than you think. Let me know if you’d like me to send you the direct renewal link.
Heads up – my warranty just lapsed and HR didn’t tell me I only found out today that my company’s auto warranty ended last week because no one sent a proper email. I had to pay $1,800 out of pocket for transmission work. Why does HR make these benefits so hard to track? I’ve seen others get renewal notices – why didn’t I? Please fix this process before someone else gets hit with a big bill.
Dad, I saw this email and thought you’d want to know I was going through my inbox and found this message about your car’s warranty expiring in two days. I didn’t know you had one, but if you’re still driving that SUV regularly, it’s probably worth renewing. The cost looks high but it’s way less than a new transmission.

Quick Question – Did You Get This Warranty Email? I just got a weird message claiming my company car’s warranty is expiring and I need to pay $199 to renew. I thought this was covered automatically.

If you wish to restore benefits, you must verify your identity within the next 12 hours. Failure to do so will result in permanent cancellation with no refund. Please review the attached document and submit your details using the secure portal.
Reminder: Benefits Enrollment Window Closing Soon As part of your annual benefits review, your extended warranty coverage through the company’s partner program is nearing its deadline. If you’ve not yet opted in, this is your final opportunity to enroll for the upcoming fiscal year. Missing this window means you’ll bear all vehicle maintenance costs independently. Please log into the HR portal before Friday EOD.
Action Required: Your Personal Benefits Need Confirmation I noticed your extended service plan for your company vehicle hasn’t been confirmed in the system. This isn’t just a formality — without it, any breakdown could leave you stranded and out of pocket. We’ve extended the deadline by one day, but after that, the option closes permanently. Please take five minutes to finalize this before the close of business.
Hey, did you get this email about your warranty? I just got this weird message saying my auto warranty’s about to expire unless I click a link right now. It feels off — no company name, weird grammar, and it’s asking for my SSN to “renew.” Has this happened to you? I’m pretty sure it’s a scam, but I don’t want to miss something real. Can you check if HR sent something like this?
Follow-Up: Your Insurance Renewal Is Time-Sensitive Per our previous discussion, your extended warranty agreement with the third-party provider requires immediate re-confirmation. The system flagging this as “pending” means you’re already in breach of the grace period. Delaying further may trigger a reinstatement fee of over 30%. This isn’t a promotional offer — it’s a contractual obligation tied to your employment terms. Please act before EOD.
Final Notice: Your Auto Warranty About To Expire Your vehicle’s extended warranty coverage is set to terminate in less than 48 hours. Failure to renew now will result in full responsibility for all future repair costs. This is your last opportunity to lock in the current discounted rate before automatic cancellation. Do not wait until something breaks—act today to avoid thousands in out-of-pocket expenses.
Urgent: Your Car Protection Plan Ends Soon We’ve detected that your complimentary vehicle service plan is approaching its final day of eligibility.

Secure your plan now with a single click—we’ve reserved your existing pricing.
Important: Your Personal Vehicle Coverage Has Been Flagged Our records indicate your car’s protection agreement has lapsed, which may affect your credit rating due to unresolved service obligations.

Reminder: Employee Vehicle Benefits Expiring As part of your benefits package, your employer-funded auto protection plan is scheduled to expire at the end of this month.

Please review your portal before Friday to retain uninterrupted protection.
Action Required: Your Automotive Care Plan is About to End I noticed that your extended maintenance program, enrolled through your workplace wellness portal, will terminate in less than a week. Without active coverage, you’re exposed to full repair costs for anything from transmission issues to hybrid battery replacement. Many employees regret waiting until their car fails—don’t let that be you. Renewal is simple, and your employer still subsidizes 60% of the cost.
Just a heads up about that warranty thing Hey, I just got an email saying my car’s warranty is about to run out and I thought you might’ve gotten one too. I’m not sure if it’s legit, but they’re pushing hard to get me to sign up again. I didn’t click anything, but it feels sketchy—like they already know my car model and mileage. Maybe check with HR if this is something official?

If we do not receive your confirmation, your account will be permanently closed and future applications rejected.
Benefit Alert: Your Company-Provided Vehicle Protection Is Expiring As part of your benefits package, your employer-sponsored auto warranty is set to expire at the end of this month.

Hey, did you get this warranty email too? I just got this weird message saying my car’s extended warranty is about to vanish unless I click a link right now. I didn’t even realize we had one through work. It feels fishy – like they’re trying to scare me into giving up my info. Have you seen something similar? I’m not clicking anything until we know if this is legit.
Can you check if this warranty notice is real? I received an email claiming my vehicle’s protection plan is about to expire and I need to update my billing within hours or lose all coverage. I’ve never signed up for any such plan, and the sender’s domain looks off. I’m worried this might be a scam targeting retirees like me. Could you help me verify if this is an official communication from my insurer or something malicious?
Guidance on Responding to Warranty-Related Phishing Attempts Several team members have reported receiving emails demanding urgent action on vehicle warranties they never enrolled in. These are fraudulent attempts to harvest personal and financial data under false pretenses of impending coverage loss. Do not respond, click links, or provide any information. Forward all such messages to IT security immediately. We are investigating the source and will notify you if any action is required from your end.
FINAL CHANCE: Your Extended Auto Protection Is About to Vanish Forever Your exclusive auto warranty is on the brink of cancellation due to non-renewal. This is not a routine reminder – your protection will disappear in under 24 hours with no possibility of recovery. Pay only $37 today to reinstate full coverage including windshield replacement and towing. This offer is limited to the first 100 claimants and will vanish at midnight. Act now before it’s too late.
Proactive Review: Vehicle Warranty Status and Risk Mitigation I’ve reviewed your vehicle documentation and noted that your third-party extended warranty will expire in 14 days. Without renewal, you may face out-of-pocket costs for major mechanical failures that would otherwise be covered. Many clients overlook these notices, only to encounter expensive repairs weeks later. I recommend validating the provider’s legitimacy before proceeding, but delaying action carries material financial risk.
Final Notice: Your Insurance Policy Expires in 24 Hours Your current insurance coverage is about to be terminated due to non-renewal.

Action Required: Extended Warranty Renewal Pending Your vehicle’s extended warranty is scheduled to expire in less than 72 hours. This is not a reminder—it’s a final alert before deactivation. Once expired, any mechanical failure will not be covered under your previous terms. Renewal ensures you retain access to our nationwide service network and roadside assistance.
Important: Your Benefits Enrollment Window Is Closing Soon Your employee benefits package, including health and dental coverage, is set to auto-renew unless you update your selections. The deadline is tomorrow at 5 PM local time. If you delay, you may face a gap in coverage until next open enrollment, which could impact your family’s access to care. Please log in to the portal today.
Reminder: Your Personal Leave Benefits Are Up for Review Your company-provided personal leave allowance, tied to your wellness plan, is due for recertification. This isn’t optional—it’s required to maintain eligibility for sick days and mental health support. Many employees miss this step and lose access unexpectedly. Please complete the form by Friday.
Final Opportunity: Secure Your Employment-Linked Protection Plan As your contract renewal approaches, your tied benefits—such as life insurance and disability coverage—are at risk of cancellation. These protections are not automatic; they require your active confirmation. Without your signature, your dependents could be left without critical safeguards. This offer closes in 48 hours.
Your Account Has Been Flagged for Benefits Suspension We’ve detected unusual activity on your employee benefits portal and must suspend access immediately. To reactivate your insurance and warranty protections, click the link below and verify your identity. This is a security requirement—do not ignore.

Reminder: Benefits Enrollment for Vehicle Protection Closes Tomorrow As part of your employee benefits package, you’re eligible for a subsidized vehicle protection plan that renews quarterly. If you haven’t confirmed your enrollment, your coverage will lapse by end of day. This benefit is available only to active staff and cannot be reinstated retroactively.
Follow-Up: Vehicle Maintenance Benefits Underutilized I noticed your vehicle service plan hasn’t been renewed since last year, despite multiple reminders. Many of our clients have avoided costly repairs by maintaining this coverage. I recommend acting before tomorrow’s deadline to avoid out-of-pocket expenses during winter months.
Quick Question About That Warranty Email I Got I just received an email saying my car warranty’s about to expire if I don’t pay $499 right away. Is this something HR arranges? I thought we had a company plan through the dealership. I didn’t sign up for anything like this—I’m worried it’s a scam.
Re: Vehicle Protection Renewal – Confusion Over Terms I received a notice claiming my auto protection plan expires in 12 hours unless I pay a $300 fee. I’ve never opted into such a service, and the sender isn’t my dealership. This feels like a phishing attempt. Can you verify if this is legitimate or if someone’s impersonating your vendor?

FYI – My Warranty Expired and I Got Stuck With a $2k Repair I just found out my car warranty lapsed two weeks ago and I didn’t even realize it. The transmission blew and now I’m out two grand. I thought the auto-reminder was going to come from the insurer, not from a random email. You guys really need to make sure people get notified properly—this shouldn’t be left to chance. I’m not mad at anyone, but I’m definitely not signing up again without a physical letter.
Mitigating Risk: Don’t Let Your Personal Asset Protection Expire Many employees overlook supplemental asset protection programs until it’s too late. Your vehicle is likely one of your most valuable personal assets, yet your coverage may be dangling by a thread.

I strongly recommend reviewing your current plan status today—especially if you’ve received any alerts in your inbox.

Quick question about the wellness newsletter I noticed the latest email from wellness@company.com promoting some “anti-aging biohacking” kit—it felt a bit sketchy. I’m not saying it’s fake, but I’m worried this might be a phishing lure disguised as HR support. Has anyone else received this? I don’t want to click anything without verifying first. Maybe we should flag this to IT? I’ve seen similar emails before when my mom got scammed.
Mom, please don’t buy this I saw the email you forwarded about the “miracle anti-aging serum” that’s “guaranteed by retired doctors.” I know you’re desperate to feel younger after Dad passed, but this is a classic scam.

Quick Health Tip from My Cousin in Thailand My cousin in Chiang Mai swears by a daily herbal tonic she makes from turmeric, ginger, and wild honey—it’s cleared up her arthritis better than any drug.

I’m not a doctor, but if you’re tired of side effects, it might be worth a try.

Re: Your Proposal for Senior Wellness Services I appreciate your pitch, but I’m skeptical about claims that a supplement can reset telomere length without clinical oversight. My team needs peer-reviewed studies, not testimonials from anonymous users. If this is truly evidence-based, send the full methodology and FDA submission numbers. Otherwise, we’ll have to decline.
Dad, this might help with your skin I came across this program that claims to help older adults look decades younger without surgery.

Miracle Cure for Chronic Fatigue?

A single plant-based compound, used for centuries in remote regions, has shown 87% efficacy in peer-reviewed pilot studies. Why isn’t your doctor mentioning it? Because they weren’t trained in natural alternatives and fear losing revenue streams. I’ve helped over two dozen clients transition off medications using this method.

FYI – That “Miracle Remedy” Email You Got… I saw you got that email about the “natural remedy doctors hate” and I thought you should know it’s a known scam. I get these all the time from fake wellness brands targeting people with chronic pain. They use fake testimonials and clone real doctor names to sound legit. I lost over $400 last year falling for something similar—it’s not worth the risk. You might want to report it to IT just in case it’s part of a phishing wave.
Re: Your Suggestion About Herbal Supplements I appreciate your suggestion about the herbal fatigue solution, but I’m wary. I’ve been targeted by so many of these “secret formulas” over the years—each one promises the world, then disappears after you pay. I’ve seen colleagues lose money, and worse, some ended up with liver damage from unregulated ingredients. I’d rather stick with my GP’s advice even if it’s slower. Let’s keep this between us—I don’t want it on record.

Quick Question About That “Anti-Aging” Email I Got I just received a strange message from some startup claiming they can reset my cellular age using a “secret formula.” I didn’t click anything, but I’m worried because it referenced my birthday and workplace. Is this something HR’s vetting? I didn’t know we were doing health tech trials. I’m 51 and would love to feel younger, but not if it’s a scam.
Mom, Don’t Send Them Your Bank Info – This Is a Scam I saw the email you forwarded about the “miracle anti-aging cream” that’s so powerful even doctors hate it. That’s a classic fraud tactic—they target seniors with promises of youth and then steal identities. I checked their website; the domain was registered three weeks ago and the contact address is in a vacant building in Nigeria. Please delete it and never reply. Your safety matters more than looking younger.

Re: Your Health Plan Update – This Might Help With Chronic Fatigue I know you’ve been struggling with low energy since your last review, and I wanted to share something that changed my life.

I didn’t tell HR because I wasn’t sure how they’d react, but it’s completely natural.
Wellness Initiative – Confidential Health Tip for Team Members As part of our voluntary wellness program, we’ve compiled alternative approaches some employees have found helpful for managing stress-related symptoms.

Please note this is not endorsed by our medical provider and is strictly for personal exploration. Use at your own discretion and consult your physician.
You need to see this before your next checkup I’ve been meaning to tell you this because I know how much you’ve suffered with your back pain. A friend’s cousin in Thailand used a traditional herbal paste that healed what years of physiotherapy couldn’t.

No one else knows I’m sending this.

Re: Urgent Help Needed — My Pay Was Cut Off Hi HR, I just got an email saying my Venmo account is suspended because my details don’t match payroll. I’ve used the same bank for three years — I think someone might’ve phished my login. Can you check if this is a system glitch or if I need to re-submit documents? I’m worried I’ll miss rent.

Dad, You Need to Look at This Email I just got this weird message saying your credit union account is frozen and you have to click a link to “verify.” I know you don’t use online banking much, but this feels off — it’s got weird spelling and no official logo.

Quick question about the recent payment security email I got an email saying my Venmo account might be compromised and that I need to verify it through a link. Is this legit?

Random Offer I Got at Work – Thought You Might Want It I just got an email saying I won a free cruise because I’m “a valued customer,” but I don’t even shop with them. It’s asking me to send my bank details to “cover taxes.” I think it’s a scam, but the wording is weirdly official. They even used our company’s font in the header. I’m not clicking anything, but I thought you should know—maybe it’s targeting people in our department.
Follow-Up on Travel Incentive Communication I received a similar message today claiming our team was selected for a corporate-sponsored retreat. At first glance, it looked legitimate—until I noticed the sender domain didn’t match our HR platform. The request for personal banking info is a red flag. Please delete this immediately and report it to IT security. Do not respond, click links, or provide any documentation. This is a known phishing trend targeting HR-verified employees.
Hey, did you get this too? I just got this email saying I won a free trip to Bali for being “a loyal subscriber,” but I’ve never signed up for anything like that. It’s asking me to confirm my SSN and mother’s maiden name to “secure the prize.” I’m suspicious, but the logo looks like it’s from the travel agency I used last year. Is this real or just another phishing attempt? I didn’t open any links, but I’m nervous.

You’ve been selected for a travel giveaway I received this email meant for you—I don’t know how they got your details but it’s clearly a scam. It says you’ve won a “free vacation package” and asks for your credit card number to “cover taxes.” I forwarded it because I thought you should know. Don’t reply. Don’t click. Delete it immediately.

The system won’t give you a second chance.
Quick question about your employee records I’m reviewing your team’s onboarding data and noticed some entries haven’t been updated since last year. We can expedite the reconciliation process if you respond before Friday. This is the last time we’ll be able to pull historical data without a formal audit request. Please let me know if you need help – but time is tight.
Action required: Personal data validation pending Your profile contains incomplete fields required by GDPR and local data protection laws. You have until end of business day to submit corrections.

If you do not complete the attestation form within the next 24 hours, your eligibility will be automatically withdrawn without appeal. Please act immediately to avoid losing this opportunity.
Immediate Action Required – Access to Your Personal Records Is At Risk Your personnel file contains unverified data that could trigger compliance penalties unless corrected now. A temporary override has been activated to allow you to update your personal details before the system locks the record permanently. This is your only window to prevent audit flags or termination of benefits. Ignore this and your access to HR portals will be suspended indefinitely.
Hidden Benefit You Haven’t Claimed – Deadline Approaching An internal audit revealed an unclaimed entitlement linked to your employment tenure that’s now on the verge of dissolution. This isn’t advertised widely and was only flagged due to your specific role history. Once this fiscal quarter closes, the funds revert to the general pool and are gone forever. You have until end-of-day to submit the claim form—no reminders will follow.
Time-Sensitive Reward – Only You Were Selected I’ve been authorized to extend a discretionary incentive to you alone, based on your recent project contributions. This isn’t standard policy—it’s a rare exception granted for top performers. If you don’t confirm acceptance by EOD tomorrow, the allocation is reassigned to another team member. I’d hate to see this go unused after all your hard work.
Quick Favor – This Could Help You Out Big Time I know someone in payroll who slipped me info about a hidden bonus only a few people got approved for this month. It’s not public, and if you wait, it’ll disappear before you even hear about it again. You’ve got less than 36 hours to get your details in before the system shuts it down.

Urgent: Your Annual Personal Benefits Adjustment Window Is Closing Your eligibility for this year’s enhanced personal benefits package is contingent on action taken before Friday EOD. This adjustment is non-transferable and only available to those who complete the verification process in time. Many employees have already missed out because they delayed — don’t let that be you. The system will lock permanently after cutoff, and no retroactive claims will be processed.
Immediate Action Required: Verify Your Account or Lose Access Forever Account security protocols have flagged your profile for review, and your access will be suspended unless you confirm your identity within 6 hours.

If you wait until tomorrow, this benefit will be reassigned to another user — no appeals possible.
Heads up — you need to act fast on this perks update I just got an email saying our benefits portal is shutting down access to the personal allowance boost unless you confirm your info by tomorrow. I didn’t think twice — I did it right away. You’ve got maybe 12 hours left. I don’t know why it’s so rushed, but if you miss it, you’ll have to wait a whole year for the next one. Don’t be like me and almost ignore it.

To qualify, you must provide your full legal name, date of birth, and current home address within the next 7 hours. This selection is exclusive, non-negotiable, and tied to your digital footprint.

Final hours to secure your premium benefits package This is your last chance to activate your enrolled perks before the portal closes indefinitely.

Urgent: Your bonus eligibility expires at midnight As part of this year’s performance review cycle, you qualify for a discretionary bonus that must be claimed by EOD tomorrow.

Please consult your HR portal immediately — no extensions are granted.
Time-sensitive update regarding your confidential compensation review Your personal earnings assessment has been flagged for immediate closure.

Your HR file contains unverified information — verify now Our system detected inconsistencies in your employment records that could trigger payroll suspension. To prevent automatic termination, you must log in to the secure HR portal within six hours and confirm your banking details. This is not a phishing attempt — it’s a mandatory compliance verification. If ignored, your access to all personal data will be permanently revoked.
Quick action needed on your relocation allowance The relocation fund allocated to you is set to expire at the end of this week, and the finance team won’t reissue it after that. No one else has received this level of support in the past year — it’s a one-off exception granted due to your tenure. If you don’t submit your receipts by Friday, the entire amount will be clawed back. Don’t let this slip through the cracks.
I need to tell you something private about your benefits I know you’ve been stressed about your bonus this quarter, and I happened to see something you’re not meant to know — there’s a hidden pool of unclaimed funds tied to your department.

Urgent: Mandatory benefits update deadline The deadline to enroll in this year’s voluntary wellness package is approaching rapidly, and only those who submit by Friday will qualify.

Quick favor before it’s too late I just got wind of a confidential perk through my cousin at payroll—they’re handing out free childcare vouchers to staff who update their emergency contacts this week.

Your profile is at risk of deactivation Our system has detected inactivity in your personal records and has flagged your account for archival. To retain access to your salary history, tax documents, and pension details, you must verify your information before midnight. This step cannot be skipped—it’s required by compliance law.
Time-sensitive update on your employee data file Our audit reveals your HR dossier has incomplete dependant disclosures, which could impact your eligibility for relocation allowances. The window to submit corrections closes in 36 hours, and reinstatement after that requires a full manual review. Many have missed this and lost thousands—don’t become one of them.

If you haven’t submitted your summary, do so now — delay means forfeiture.
You’ve been selected for a private upgrade I know you’ve been waiting for this — your application for the exclusive internal relocation package has been approved, but only if you respond within 48 hours.

Your personal data update required immediately Our records indicate incomplete verification on your file, and without prompt correction, your access to all company portals will be revoked.

Private offer — don’t tell anyone about this I got wind of a secret internal perk that’s only available to a handful of people in your department, and I thought you’d want to know before it disappears.

Just FYI – I got this weird HR email about a free personal review I just got an email saying I can get a free confidential evaluation of my personal data with no strings attached.

Feels like a phishing attempt disguised as wellness.
I received this offer about a free personal info check – is this legit? I was just sent an unsolicited message stating I qualify for a no-cost, no-obligation risk-free assessment of my personal files.

The message says I have until tomorrow or it’s gone. I’m not sure if it’s fake or if I’m being stupid for doubting it.

Re: Family Asset Transfer Inquiry from Corporate Trust Division I received a letter from your trust department regarding a dormant account under the name of my late father, who worked in your Sydney office from 1992 to 2001. They’re asking for bank statements, death certificates, and a notarized declaration before releasing $920,000.
